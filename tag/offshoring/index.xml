      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never worked on a distributed or offshore project before, but intrigued having read about Jay Fields&amp;rsquo; experiences I attended the &amp;lsquo;OffShoring: The Current State of Play&amp;rsquo; Quarterly Technology Briefing held this morning in Sydney to hear the other side of the argument.
The underlying message for me was that a lot of the concepts we apply for onshore projects are equally important for offshore projects.
Forrester&amp;rsquo;s Tim Sheedy started off by providing some research data on the state of IT offshoring, some reasons he had identified around which type of work should be offshored before closing on some reasons that it might fail if not done correctly.</description>
