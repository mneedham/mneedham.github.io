      <description>At XP Day I was chatting to Benjamin Mitchell about the 5 whys exercises that we&amp;rsquo;d tried on my team and I suggested that beyond Eric Ries&amp;rsquo; post on the subject I hadn&amp;rsquo;t come across an article/video which explained how to do it.
Benjamin mentioned that Douglas Squirrel had recently done a talk on this very subject at Skillsmatter and as with most Skillsmatter talks there&amp;rsquo;s a video of the presentation online.</description>
