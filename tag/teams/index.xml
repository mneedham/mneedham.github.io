      <description>On the majority of the teams that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on there&amp;rsquo;s been a time where everyone seems to be disagreeing with each other about almost everything and the whole situation becomes pretty tense for all involved.

I was particularly interested in learning whether the ideas of agile and/or lean help to solve any of these dysfunctions.
What did I learn?  The book is split into two sections.</description>
