      <description>The alternative to dealing with java.util.Date which I wrote about in a previous post is to make use of the Joda Time library. I&amp;rsquo;m led to believe that a lot of the ideas from Joda Time will in fact be in Java 7.
Nevertheless when testing with Joda Time there are times when it would be useful for us to have control over the time our code is using.
Why would we want to control the time?</description>
