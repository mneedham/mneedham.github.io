      <description>One of the trickiest things to do when working in bigger teams is ensuring that it is possible to parallelise the work we have across the number of pairs that we have available.
From my experience this problem happens much less frequently in smaller teams. Perhaps inevitably it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to find 2 or 3 things that can be worked on in parallel than it is to find 6 or 7 or more.</description>
