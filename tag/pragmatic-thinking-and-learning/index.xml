      <description>The Book Pragmatic Learning and Thinking by Andy Hunt
The Review I came across this book when reading a post linking lean to the Dreyfus Model on Dan North&amp;rsquo;s blog.
I have a keen interest in theories of learning and have completed an NLP Practitioner&amp;rsquo;s course so the ideas described in the book summary immediately appealed to me.
After coming across the concept of Reading Deliberately in Chapter 6 of the book I decided I should give the SQ3Q approach to reading books its first run out.</description>
