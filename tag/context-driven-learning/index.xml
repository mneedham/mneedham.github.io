      <description>One pattern I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed over the last couple of years with regards to my own learning is that I find it very difficult to learn new things unless I can directly apply what I have learnt to a real life situation.
I feel this was part of the reason I found the way material is taught at universities so difficult to understand - nearly every course I studied was taught on its own without any reference to the others, and rarely did I get to use the ideas I learnt in a practical context.</description>
