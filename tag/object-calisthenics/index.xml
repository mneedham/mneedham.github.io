      <description>We ran an Object Calisthenics variation of Coding Dojo on Wednesday night as part of ThoughtWorks Geek Night in Sydney.
Object Calisthenics is an idea suggest by Jeff Bay in The ThoughtWorks Anthology , and lists 9 rules to writing better Object Oriented code. For those who haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the book, the 9 rules are:
 Use only one level of indentation per method  Don&#39;t use the else keyword Wrap all primitives and strings Use only one dot per line Don&#39;t abbreviate Keep all entities small Don&#39;t use any classes with more than two instance variables Use first-class collections Don&#39;t use any getters/setters/properties  We decided to try and solve the Bowling Game Problem while applying these rules.</description>
