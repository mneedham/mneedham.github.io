      <description>As I mentioned previously we&amp;rsquo;re making use of multiple cruise agents in our build to allow us to run our acceptance tests in parallel, therefore allowing a build which would be nearly 2 hours if run in sequence to be completed in around 10 minutes.
Early on with this approach we were getting a lot of failures in our builds which weren&amp;rsquo;t directly related to the code being changed and were more to do with the various dependencies we were making use of.</description>
