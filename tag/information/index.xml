      <description>Sometimes the simplest things can provide the greatest value to project teams. We often look for a technical solution to problems where something simpler would achieve the same aim.
The Information Wall is as its name may suggest a place where you can put information that people in the team need to know but which they have not (yet) committed to memory.
