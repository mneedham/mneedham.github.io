      <description>I had my first opportunity to participate in release plan estimation over the last couple of weeks. I&amp;rsquo;ve done estimation before but never at such a high level.
When doing this it appeared clear that there were two situations that we were trying to avoid:
Under estimating Under estimating is where we predict that the amount of time taken to complete a piece of work will be less than it actually is.</description>

      <description>I touched earlier on the transparency of agile and I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about some of the ways that we track/report information in agile projects.
In all the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in the data being tracked almost exclusively referred to development time. One of the advantages of having continuous analysis/development/testing is that we are able to reduce the time spent on the System Integration and User Acceptance Testing phases of the project.</description>

      <description>One of the key ideas behind agile software development is providing information as early as possible to allow the business to best make decisions.
There are a variety of ways that this is done including the use of burn up charts, estimates of scope and velocity for example. This data is compiled to try and give an accurate idea of how long a project is likely to take so that the business can work out early on whether the value it adds is worth the expected cost.</description>
