      <description>Continuing with my analysis of the Neo4j London user group I wanted to drill into some individual meetups and see the makeup of the people attending those meetups with respect to the cohort they belong to.  I started by writing a function which would take in an event ID and output a bar chart showing the number of people who attended that event from each cohort.   We can work out the cohort that a member belongs to by querying for the first event they attended.</description>

      <description>As part of a talk I gave at the Neo4j London meetup earlier this week I wanted to show how you could build a simple chart showing the number of friends that different actors had using the ggplot library. I started out with the following code:
df = read.csv(&amp;quot;/tmp/friends.csv&amp;quot;) top = df %&amp;gt;% head(20) ggplot(aes(x = p.name, y = colleagues), data = top) + geom_bar(fill = &amp;quot;dark blue&amp;quot;, stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;)  The friends CSV file is available as a gist if you want to reproduce the chart.</description>
