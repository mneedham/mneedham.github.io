      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with neo4j using the neography gem to create a graph of all the people in ThoughtWorks and the connections between them based on working with each other.
I created a UI where you could type in the names of two people and see when they&amp;rsquo;ve worked together or the path between the shortest path between them if they haven&amp;rsquo;t.
I thought it would be cool to have auto complete functionality when typing in a name but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to partially query the index of people&amp;rsquo;s names that I&amp;rsquo;d created.</description>
