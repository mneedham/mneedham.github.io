      <description>As I mentioned a couple of months ago, while I was in India I was acting as the Tech Lead on the project the TWU grads were working on and one thing I learnt from doing that is the importance of trying to keep the passion of the developers on the team.
When we started off I was more focused on trying to encourage the team to try and develop as many of the stories as possible.</description>
