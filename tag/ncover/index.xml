      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending quite a bit of time setting up NCover and then integrating it into Team City.
I&amp;rsquo;ve read some posts which cover parts of this process but nothing which covers the end to end process so hopefully my experience can help to fill that void.
Step 1 Download NCover 1.5.8, NCover Explorer 1.4.0.7, NCover Explorer Extras 1.4.0.5 from Kiwidude&#39;s website and the NCover website . Step 2 Put the following into your Nant build file: ~~~text ~~~ I put this right at the top of the build but I expect it doesn&#39;t matter where it goes as long as it&#39;s called at some stage before NCover and NCover Explorer are called.</description>

      <description>When writing build scripts it&amp;rsquo;s very easy for it to descend into complete Xml hell when you&amp;rsquo;re using a tool like nant.
I wondered previously whether it was possible to TDD build files and while this is difficult given the dependency model most build tools follow. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we can&amp;rsquo;t apply other good design principles from the coding world however.
Encapsulation is one of the key principles of OOP and it can be applied in build files too.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to integrate NCover into our build and probably making life harder for myself than it needs to be.
The title refers to the error message that I was getting when trying to run the ncover nant task on version 1.0.1 of NCover earlier today.
[ncover] Starting &#39;C:\Program Files\NCover\ncover-console.exe (//r &amp;quot;\long\path\to\tmp392.tmp.ncoversettings&amp;quot; )&#39; in &#39;C:\my-project\trunk\src&#39; [ncover] Unhandled Exception: System.ArgumentException: Requested value &#39;/r&#39; was not found. [ncover] at System.Enum.Parse(Type enumType, String value, Boolean ignoreCase) [ncover] at NCover.</description>
