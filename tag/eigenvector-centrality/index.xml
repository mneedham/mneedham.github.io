      <description>Earlier in the week I wrote a blog post showing how to calculate the eigenvector centrality of an adjacency matrix using JBLAS and the next step was to work out the eigenvector centrality of a neo4j sub graph.
There were 3 steps involved in doing this:
 Export the neo4j sub graph as an adjacency matrix Run JBLAS over it to get eigenvector centrality scores for each node Write those scores back into neo4j  I decided to make use of the Paul Revere data set from Kieran Healy&#39;s blog post which consists of people and groups that they had membership of.</description>
