      <description>A couple of weeks ago Channing Walton tweeted the following:
 Every time you call get on an Option a kitten dies.  As Channing points out in the comments he was referring to unguarded calls to &amp;lsquo;get&amp;rsquo; which would lead to an exception if the Option was empty, therefore pretty much defeating the point of using an Option in the first place!
We&amp;rsquo;re using Dan Bodart&amp;rsquo;s totallylazy library on the application I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on and in fact were calling &amp;lsquo;get&amp;rsquo; on an Option so I wanted to see if we could get rid of it.</description>
