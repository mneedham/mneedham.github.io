      <title>Vagrant: Multi (virtual) machine with Puppet roles</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with setting up a neo4j cluster using Vagrant and HAProxy and one thing I wanted to do was define two different roles for the HAProxy and neo4j machines.
When I was working at uSwitch Nathan had solved a similar problem, but with AWS VMs, by defining the role in an environment variable in the VM&#39;s spin up script.
In retrospect I think I might have been able to do that by using the shell provisioner and calling that before the puppet provisioner but Nathan, Gareth Rushgrove and Gregor Russbuelt suggested that using facter might be better.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my previous post I&#39;ve been playing around with Vagrant for the past couple of days and I was trying to adapt a Vagrantfile that Nathan created a few months ago to do what I wanted.
I&#39;m using Vagrant 1.2.2 and I started out with the following Vagrantfile:
Vagrant.configure(&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;) do |config| config.vm.box = &amp;quot;precise64&amp;quot; config.vm.box_url = &amp;quot;http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box&amp;quot; config.vm.define :neo01 do |neo| neo.vm.network :hostonly, &amp;quot;192.168.33.101&amp;quot; neo.vm.forward_port 8080, 4569 end end  Unfortunately a &#39;vagrant up&#39; doesn&#39;t quite work as expected:</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with Vagrant a bit again lately and having installed it on a new machine was running into the following exception when I tried to run &#39;vagrant up&#39; on a new virtual machine:

      <description>In order to run the neo4j server on my Ubuntu 12.04 Vagrant VM I needed to install the Oracle/Sun JDK which proved to be more difficult than I&#39;d expected.
I initially tried to install it via the OAB-Java script but was running into some dependency problems and eventually came across a post which specified a PPA that had an installer I could use.
I wrote a little puppet Java module to wrap the commands in:</description>
