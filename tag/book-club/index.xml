      <description>My colleague David Santoro has started up a technical book club at the client we&amp;rsquo;re working at in Wales and the book choice for the first session was Chapter 7 - Achieving Object Oriented Design - of Growing Object Oriented Software, guided by tests written by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.
In this chapter they cover various approaches for driving towards object oriented code including techniques to find new objects and a detailed description of TDD and how we can approach this in a way that allows us to drive out new behaviour effectively.</description>

      <description>In the last Sydney book club that I attended before I moved back to the UK we discussed Chapters 12 and 13 of Michael Feathers&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;lsquo;
Liz has taken over the summarising of the book club now that I&amp;rsquo;m not there so if you want to keep on reading about the book club Liz&amp;rsquo;s blog is the place to go!

      <description>In our latest technical book club we discussed chapter 11 - &amp;lsquo;I Need to Make a Change. What Methods Should I Test?&amp;rsquo; - of Michael Feathers&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;rsquo;.
In this chapter Feathers covers some techniques which allow us to work out which parts of the code we need to write tests around when we make changes.
These are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the chapter:</description>

      <description>In our latest technical book club we discussed chapter 10 - &amp;lsquo;I Can&amp;rsquo;t Run This Method in a Test Harness&amp;rsquo; - of Michael Feather&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;rsquo;.
In this chapter Feathers outlines some of the problems we might have getting methods under test and then suggests some ways to get around those problems.
These are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the chapter:
 I quite like the idea of pragmatic refactoring that Feathers suggests early on in the chapter: Ideally, it would be great to break it down into smaller classes, but we have to carefully consider whether we want to do that much refactoring right now.</description>

      <description>In our latest technical book club we discussed chapter 9 - &amp;lsquo;I Can&amp;rsquo;t Get This Class Into A Test Harness&amp;rsquo; - of Michael Feather&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;rsquo;.
This chapter goes through various problems that we might have getting a class under test and then suggests different techniques to get around those problems.
These are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the chapter:
 One approach that Feathers describes when dealing with constructors which take in a lot of values is to just pass in nulls for the parameters that we don&#39;t care about.</description>

      <description>In our latest technical book club we discussed chapter 8 - &amp;lsquo;How do I add a feature?&amp;rsquo; - of Michael Feather&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;rsquo;.
This chapter covers Test Driven Development and a technique I hadn&amp;rsquo;t come across before called Programming By Difference.
These are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the chapter:
 In the section on TDD Feathers mentions the copy/paste/refactor pattern which I wrote about a few days ago.</description>

      <description>In our latest technical book club we covered chapters 6 &amp;amp; 7 - &amp;lsquo;I Don&amp;rsquo;t Have Much Time And I Have To Change It&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;It Takes Forever To Make A Change&amp;rsquo; - of Michael Feathers&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;rsquo;.
The first chapter discusses various different techniques that we can use to add in new code to a legacy code base. These include:
 Sprout method - create a new method for our new functionality and make a call to it from existing code.</description>

      <description>In our latest technical book club we discussed chapters 3,4 and 5 of Michael Feathers&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;rsquo; - &amp;lsquo;Sensing and Separation&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;The Seam Model&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Tools&amp;rsquo;.
These are some of my thoughts from our discussion of these chapters:
 Feathers suggests two reasons why we break dependencies when trying to get tests in place - sensing and separation. The former involves the breaking of dependencies in order to get access to the values computed in our code and the latter is necessary so that we can get our code into a test harness to start with.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go back to reading a book in our technical book club after a few months of discussing different papers and the chosen book is Michael Feathers&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;rsquo;.
We started off by reading the first two chapters titled &amp;lsquo;Changing Software&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Working with Feedback&amp;rsquo; and these are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the chapters:
 Early on Feathers talks about the need to change software in order to add features and fix bugs and while it is certainly necessary to make some changes to code in order to do this we discussed whether there is ever a time that we might look to keep the number of changes we&#39;re making to a minimum.</description>

      <description>In our latest book club we discussed J.B. Rainsberger&amp;rsquo;s presentation from Agile 2009 titled &amp;lsquo;Integration tests are a scam&amp;rsquo;.
These are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the video:
 While talking about how to write interaction tests he suggests that we should only be looking to create interfaces for Domain Driven Design services. If we find ourselves wanting to create interfaces for entities or value objects then we probably have a service wanting to get out.</description>

      <description>In our latest technical book club we discussed a presentation given at the Norwegian Developers Conference by Michael Feathers titled &amp;lsquo;Design Sense&amp;rsquo;.
In this presentation he presents quite a number of different ideas that he has learned from his experiences in software development over the years.
These are some of my thoughts and our discussion:
 The first part of the presentation talks about method size and Feathers observes that there seems to be a power law with relation to the size of methods in code bases - i.</description>

      <description>In our latest technical book club we discussed a series of posts written by K. Scott Allen about getting your database under version control.
 Three rules for database work The baseline Change scripts Views, Stored Procedures and the like Branching and Merging  These are some of my thoughts and our discussion:
 We had an interesting discussion around when it&#39;s ok to go and change checked in change scripts - on previous projects I&#39;ve worked on we&#39;ve actually had the rule that once you&#39;ve checked in a change script to source control then you can no longer change it but instead need to add another change script that does what you want.</description>

      <description>In our latest technical book club we discussed Uncle Bob Martin&amp;rsquo;s presentation to the Norwegian Developers Conference on &amp;lsquo;SOLID Design&amp;rsquo;.
These principles of object oriented design are also written up on Uncle Bob&amp;rsquo;s website and are also in his book &amp;lsquo;Agile Principles, Patterns and Practices&amp;rsquo;.
I read most of the book a couple of years ago but I don&amp;rsquo;t always remember all of the principles when I&amp;rsquo;m coding so it was good to revisit them again.</description>

      <description>In this weeks book club we discussed Arlo Belshee&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;lsquo;Promiscuous Pairing and Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Mind&amp;rsquo; where he presents the idea of rotating pairs more frequently than we might usually, suggesting that the optimal rotation time is 90 minutes.
I remember coming across the idea of promiscuous pairing a couple of years ago but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t read the paper all the way through and so far haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on a team where we&amp;rsquo;ve really tried out his ideas.</description>

      <description>In this week&amp;rsquo;s book club we continued with the idea of discussing videos, this week&amp;rsquo;s selection being Greg Young&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Unshackle your Domain&amp;rsquo; presentation from QCon San Francisco in November 2008. He also did a version of this talk in the February European Alt.NET meeting.
In this presentation Greg talks about Command Query Separation at the architecture level and explicit state transitions amongst other things.
Jonathan Oliver has created a useful resource page of the material that&amp;rsquo;s been written about some of these ideas as well.</description>

I was lucky enough to be able to attend this presentation live and we previously ran a book club where I briefly summarised what I&amp;rsquo;d learnt but this gave everyone else an opportunity to see it first hand.
There are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the presentation:</description>

      <description>In last week&amp;rsquo;s book club we discussed an article written by Jeremy Miller for MSDN Magazine titled &amp;lsquo;Object Role Stereotypes&amp;rsquo; which discusses part of Rebecca Wirfs Brock&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;lsquo;Object Design&amp;rsquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to read Object Design for about a year since coming across the book while reading through the slides from JAOO Sydney 2008 but I&amp;rsquo;ve often found the reading to be quite abstract and have struggled to work out how to apply the ideas to the coding I do day to day.</description>

      <description>In our latest book club we discussed Alistair Cockburn&amp;rsquo;s Hexagonal Architecture which I first heard about around a year ago and was another of Dave Cameron&amp;rsquo;s recommendations.
As I understand it, the article describes an architecture for our systems where the domain sits in the centre and other parts of the system depend on the domain while the domain doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on anything concrete but is interacted with by various adapters.</description>

      <description>Our latest book club session was a discussion on a paper written by my colleague Chris Stevenson and Andy Pols titled &amp;lsquo;An Agile Approach to a Legacy System&amp;rsquo; which I think was written in 2004. This paper was suggested by Dave Cameron.
These are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the paper:
 The first thing that was quite interesting was that the authors pointed out that if you just try and rewrite a part of a legacy system you are actually just writing legacy code yourself - we weren&#39;t sure exactly what was meant by this since for me at least the definition of legacy code is &#39;code which we are scared to change [because it has no tests]&#39; but presumably the new code did have tests so it wasn&#39;t legacy in this sense.</description>

      <description>Our latest technical book club discussion was based around Philip Wadler&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;lsquo;Why noone uses functional langauges&amp;rsquo; which he wrote in 1998. I came across this paper when reading some of the F# goals in the FAQs on the Microsoft website.
These are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the paper:
 One of the points suggested in the paper is that functional languages aren&#39;t used because of their lack of availability on machines but as Dave pointed out this doesn&#39;t really seem to be such a big problem these days - certainly for F# I&#39;ve found it relatively painless to get it setup and running and even for a language like Ruby people are happy to download and install it on their machines and it is also pretty much painless to do so.</description>

      <description>Our latest technical book club session was a discussion of the logging section in Michael Nygard&amp;rsquo;s Release It.
I recently listened to an interview with Michael Nygard on Software Engineering Radio so I was interested in reading more of his stuff and Cam suggested that the logging chapter would be an interesting one to look at as it&amp;rsquo;s often something which we don&amp;rsquo;t spend a lot of time thinking about on software development teams.</description>
