      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on a few different agile projects and one of the things that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been completely consistent is when we consider a story to be &amp;lsquo;done&amp;rsquo;.
There seem to a few different approaches, each of which has its benefits and drawbacks.
Why do we care? We care about &#39;done&#39; for tracking the points we have achieved in an iteration and for knowing when we have added the value the story provides.</description>
