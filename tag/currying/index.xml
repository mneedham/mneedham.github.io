      <description>In my continued reading of F# one of the ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve come across recently is that of partial function application.
This is a way of allowing us to combine different functions together and allows some quite powerful syntax to be written.
The term &amp;lsquo;currying&amp;rsquo; is perhaps a better known term for describing this although as I understand they are not exactly the same.
Currying is where we return a function that has been partially applied, in such a way that we can chain together a group of functions with a single argument.</description>
