      <description>The Book The Mythical Man Month by Fred Brooks Junior
The Review Pretty much since I started working at ThoughtWorks 2 1&amp;frasl;2 years ago I&amp;rsquo;ve been told that this is a book I have to read and I&amp;rsquo;ve finally got around to doing so.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not that surprising but my overriding thought about the book is that just about every mistake that we make in software development today is covered in this book!</description>
