      <description>I picked up Venkat Subramaniam&#39;s &#39;Functional Programming in Java: Harnessing the Power of Java 8 Lambda Expressions&#39; to learn a little bit more about Java 8 having struggled to find any online tutorials which did that.
A big chunk of the book focuses on lambdas, functional collection parameters and lazy evaluation which will be familiar to users of C#, Clojure, Scala, Haskell, Ruby, Python, F# or libraries like totallylazy and Guava.</description>

      <description>I picked up Daniel Kahneman&#39;s &#39;Thinking Fast and Slow&#39; after a recommendation by Mike Jones in early 2013 - it&#39;s taken me quite a while to get through it.
The book starts by describing our two styles of thinking...
 System 1 – operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.  System 2 – allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations.</description>

      <description>I first came across William Zinsser&#39;s &#39;On Writing Well&#39; about a year ago, but put it down having flicked through a couple of the chapters that I felt were relevant.
It came back onto my radar a month ago and this time I decided to read it cover to cover as I was sure there were some insights that I&#39;d missed due to my haphazard approach the first time around.</description>

      <description>The Book Taiichi Ohno&amp;rsquo;s Workplace Management by Taiichi Ohno
The Review Having completed The Toyota Way a few weeks ago I was speaking with Jason about what books were good to read next - he recommended this one and The Toyota Way Fieldbook.
I struggled to see a connection to software development with a lot of what I read, but there were certainly words of wisdom that we can apply to continuously improve our ability to deliver projects.</description>
