      <description>A few weeks ago I was looking at quite an interesting bug in our system which initially didn&amp;rsquo;t seem possible.
On one of our screens we have some questions that the user fills in which read a bit like this:
 Do you have a foo?  Is your foo an approved foo? Is your foo special?    i.e. you would only see the 2nd and 3rd questions on the screen if you answered yes to the first question.</description>
