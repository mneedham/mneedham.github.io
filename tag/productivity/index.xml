      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Neal Ford&amp;rsquo;s The Productive Programmer (my review) which is a book all about improving your productivity as an individual developer.
It got me thinking that there are also ways that we can make teams more productive so that they are actually teams and not just a group of individuals who happen to work with each other.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity of working under some great Tech Leads who have helped create an environment where teams can perform to their maximum.</description>
