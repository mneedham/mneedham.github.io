      <description>One thing that we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on recently is the logging for our current code base.
Nearly all the objects in our system are being created by Pico Container so we decided that writing an interceptor that hooked into Pico Container would be the easiest way to intercept and log any exceptions throw from our code.
Our initial Googling led us to the AOP Style Interception page on the Pico website which detailed how we could create a static proxy for a class that we put in the container.</description>
