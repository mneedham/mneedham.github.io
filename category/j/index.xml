      <description>A couple of months ago I wrote about tacit programming with respect to F#, a term which I first came across while reading about the J programming language.
There&amp;rsquo;s a good introduction to tacit programming on the J website which shows the evolution of a function which originally has several local variables into a state where it has none at all.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a go at writing Roy Osherove&amp;rsquo;s TDD Kata in J and while I haven&amp;rsquo;t got very far yet I saw a good opportunity to move the code I&amp;rsquo;ve written so far into a more tacit style.</description>
