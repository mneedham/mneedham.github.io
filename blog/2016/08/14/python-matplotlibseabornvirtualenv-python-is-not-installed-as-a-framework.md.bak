<p>
Over the weekend I was following <a href="https://github.com/thomhopmans/themarketingtechnologist">The Marketing Technologist's</a> content based recommender tutorial but ran into the following exception when trying to import the seaborn library:

~~~bash

RuntimeError: Python is not installed as a framework. The Mac OS X backend will not be able to function correctly if Python is not installed as a framework. See the Python documentation for more information on installing Python as a framework on Mac OS X. Please either reinstall Python as a framework, or try one of the other backends. If you are Working with Matplotlib in a virtual enviroment see 'Working with Matplotlib in Virtual environments' in the Matplotlib FAQ

<p>
We can see from the stacktrace that seaborn calls matplotlib so that's where the problem lies. There's even a <a href="http://matplotlib.org/faq/virtualenv_faq.html">page on the matplotlib website suggesting some workarounds</a>.
</p>


<p>
I've come across this error before and been unable to get any of the suggestions to work, but this time I was successful. I needed to create the following function in my bash profile file:
</p>


<p>
<cite>
~/.bash_profile
</cite>
</p>



~~~text

function frameworkpython {
    if [[ ! -z "$VIRTUAL_ENV" ]]; then
        PYTHONHOME=$VIRTUAL_ENV /usr/bin/python "$@"
    else
        /usr/bin/python "$@"
    fi
}
~~~

<p>
And call that function instead of my virtualenv's python:
</p>



~~~bash

$ frameworkpython 5_content_based_recommender/run.py 
~~~

<p>This time the matplotlib visualisation works:</p>
