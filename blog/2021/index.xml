      <description>This is another post describing my exploration of Materialize, a SQL streaming database. In this post we&amp;#8217;re going to learn how to create multiple views on top of the same underlying source.
   We&amp;#8217;re still going to be using data extracted from Strava, an app that I use to record my runs, but this time we have more detailed information about each run. As in the previous blog posts, each run is represented as JSON document and store in the activities-detailed-all.</description>
