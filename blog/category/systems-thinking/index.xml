      <description>Earlier this year Liz Keoghgave a talk at QCon London titled &amp;lsquo;Learning and Perverse Incentives: The Evil Hat&amp;rsquo; where she eventually encouraged people to try and game the systems that they take part in.
Over the last month or so we&amp;rsquo;ve had two different metrics visibly on show and are therefore prime targets for being gamed.
The first metric is one we included on our build radiator which shows how many commits to the git repository each person has for that day.</description>

      <title>Bounded Rationality</title>

      <description>In Thinking In Systems: A Primer&#39; one of the most interesting ideas that Donella Meadows describes is what Herbert Simon coined bounded rationality:
  Bounded rationality means that people make quite reasonable decisions based on the information they have. But they don&amp;#8217;t have perfect information, especially about more distant parts of the system
   Later on in the chapter the following idea is suggested:
  If you become a manager, you probably will stop seeing labour as a deserving partner in production, and start seeing it as a cost to be minimised.</description>

      <title>System Traps: Rule Beating</title>

      <description>In &amp;lsquo;Thinking In Systems&amp;rsquo; section five focuses on systems which produce &amp;ldquo;truly problematic behaviour&amp;rdquo; and one of these so called system traps is known as &amp;lsquo;rule beating&amp;rsquo;.
Rule beating occurs when the agents in a system take evasive action to get around the intent of rules in a system:
A common system where we see this in organisations is around training budgets.
Each individual will be given a certain amount of money to spend each year and if they don&amp;rsquo;t spend it then they lose it.</description>

      <title>Feedback Loops: Human Decisions</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Donella Meadows&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Thinking In Systems: A Primer&amp;rsquo;, an introductory text on systems thinking, and after 30 pages or so the author poses the following challenge:
Meadows has quite a nice way of guiding us to thinking about systems by referring to &amp;lsquo;stocks&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;flows&amp;rsquo;.
For example the following diagram represents the flows into and out from a water reservoir:
The &amp;lsquo;water in reservoir&amp;rsquo; is the stock in this system while rain/river inflow act as the in flows and evaporation/discharge are the out flows.</description>

      <title>Chris Argyris: Espoused Theory vs Theory in Action</title>

      <description>Via some combination of Christian Blunden, Pat Kua, David Joyceand Benjamin MitchellI&amp;rsquo;ve been spending some time lately reading about the work of Chris Argyris.
I&amp;rsquo;ve previously come across his name while reading The Fifth Disciplinebut I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise how interesting his work actually is.
One of the interesting concepts I&amp;rsquo;ve come across so far is the difference between espoused theory and theory in use:
Espoused theory
Theory-in-use
There are two areas that really stood out for me when I read these definitions.</description>

      <title>Systems Thinking: Individuals and the environment</title>
      <link>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2010/11/23/systems-thinking-individuals-and-the-environment/</link>

      <description>Something which I&amp;rsquo;ve become fairly convinced about recently is that the environment that someone works in has far more impact on their perceived performance than their own individual skills.
Given that belief I&amp;rsquo;ve often got stuck answering why some people are better able to handle a difficult environment than others - in terms of accepting the situation and finding a way of being productive regardless.
Does this mean that they&amp;rsquo;re better than people who can&amp;rsquo;t work in that environment as effectively?</description>

      <title>Feedback loops: Overcompensating</title>
      <link>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2010/10/24/feedback-loops-overcompensating/</link>

      <description>One of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed while working with various colleagues over the last few years is that the more experienced ones are much more skilled at making slight adjustments to their approach based on feedback that they receive from the environment.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a coupleof bookson systems thinking over the last few months and one of the takeaways for me has been that we need to be careful when reacting to feedback we get from a system to ensure that we don&amp;rsquo;t over compensate and end up creating a new problem for ourselves instead.</description>
