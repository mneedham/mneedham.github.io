      <description>As I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned previously I think the Kindle application on the iPad is the best one for reading books and as a result of that I wanted to be able to read some books which I&amp;#8217;d bought from the PragProg store onto it.
 The first step is to download the &#39;.mobi&#39; version of the book and use iPhoneExplorer to drag the file into the &#39;Kindle/Documents/eBook&#39; folder on the iPad.</description>
