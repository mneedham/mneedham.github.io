      <description>I wrote a couple of weeks ago about how we&amp;rsquo;d been trying to make use of the NHibernate 2nd level cacheand we were able to cache our data by following the various posts that I listed.
Unfortunately when we ran some performance tests we found that the performance of the application was significantly worse than when we just wrote our own &amp;lsquo;cache&amp;rsquo; - an object which had a dictionary containing the reference data items we&amp;rsquo;d previously tried to lookup and the appropriate values.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to cache some objects using NHibernate&amp;rsquo;s second level cache which always proves to be a trickier task than I remember it being the previous time!
We&amp;rsquo;re storing some reference data in the database and then using LINQ to NHibernate to query for the specific row that we want based on some user entered criteria.
We can cache that query by calling &amp;lsquo;SetCacheable&amp;rsquo; on the &amp;lsquo;QueryOptions&amp;rsquo; property of our query:</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been fiddling around with Fluent NHibernatea bit over the last couple of days and one of the things that we wanted to do was output the NHibernate mapping files being generated so we could see if they were as expected.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to do it but thanks to the help of James Gregory, Andrew Bullockand Matthew Erbson twitter this is the code that you need in order to do that:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading through a bit of Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Growing Object Oriented Software guided by tests&amp;rsquo; book and I found the following observation in chapter 7 quite interesting:
It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that they don&amp;rsquo;t try and write perfect code the first time around which is actually something I thought experienced developers did until I came across Uncle Bob&amp;rsquo;s Clean Codebook where he suggested something similar.
One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed when working with collections is that if we want to do something more complicated than just doing a simple map or filter then I find myself initially trying to work through the problem in an imperative hacky way.</description>

      <description>Continuing with my mini Hibernate mappings series, this post talks about the different ways of setting up the test datafor our Hibernate tests.
There are a couple of ways that we can setup data for Hibernate tests.
The benefit of this approach is that our test is pretty clean. It looks like any old unit test where we create an object and then check that what we get back is the same object.</description>

      <description>I started a mini Hibernate series with my last postwhere I spoke of there being three main areas to think about when it comes to testing:
Once we have worked out where to test the mappings from, if we have decided to test them through either our repository tests or directly from the Hibernate session then we have some choices to make around how to test for equality.
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this done in several ways:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to work with Hibernateand it&amp;rsquo;s .NET twin NHibernateon several of my projects and one of the more interesting decisions around its use is working out the best way to test the hibernate mappings that hook together our domain model and the database.
There are three decisions to make around how best to do this:
This post will focus on the ways I have seen with regards to choosing where to test the mappings from.</description>
