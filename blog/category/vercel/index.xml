      <description>We’re deploying the StarTree developer site, dev.startree.ai, to Vercel, and recently needed to do some redirects of a few pages. I initially added individual redirects for each page, but there were eventually too many pages and I wanted to automate it. In this post we’ll learn how to do that.
