      <description>As I mentioned in my last blog post, I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with Apache Pinot, a data store that&amp;#8217;s optimised for user facing analytical workloads.
   My understanding is that Pinot is a really good fit for datasets where:

In this blog post I want to walk through some challenges I had connecting to Pinot using the Python driver and how I got things working.
 I&amp;#8217;m running Pinot locally using the Docker image, which I setup in a Docker compose file:
 docker-compose.yml version: &#39;3.7&#39; services: pinot: image: apachepinot/pinot:0.</description>
