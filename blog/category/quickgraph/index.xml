      <description>It’s been several months since our last QuickGraph and the world feels very different than it was back then. I’ve been reading a couple of books about viruses - Spillover and Pale Rider - and am now very curious to learn more about the medical terms reference in the books.
With the Pre Release of neosemantics (n10s) for Neo4j 4.0, I thought it would be interesting to create a graph of the taxonomy of the virus that caused COVID-19, using data extracted from Wikidata’s SPARQL API.</description>

      <title>Neo4j: Performing a database dump within a Docker container</title>

      <description>Before the release of Neo4j 4.0, taking a dump of a database running within a Docker container was a tricky affair.
We’d need to stop the container and remove it, run the container again in bash mode, and finally take a dump of the database. With 4.0 things are simpler.

      <description>It’s time for another QuickGraph, this one based on data from the Australian Open tennis tournament. We’re going to use data curated by Jeff Sackmann in the tennis_wta and tennis_atp repositories.

      <description>For our first QuickGraph of the new decade we’re going to explore data from the Official UK Top 40 Chart. This chart ranks the top 100 songs of the week based on official sales of sales of downloads, CD, vinyl, audio streams and video streams. Every week BBC Radio 1 broadcast the top 40 songs, which explains the name of the chart.
Figure 1. The Official UK Charts Scraping the Official Charts I couldn’t find a dump of the dataset, so we’re going to use our web scraping skills again.</description>

      <title>QuickGraph #3: Itsu Allergens</title>

      <description>As someone who’s allergic to lots of different things, the introduction of allergen charts in restaurants over the last few years has been very helpful. These charts are often hidden away in PDF files, but the Asian inspired Itsu restaurant have all this information available on their online menus. This therefore seemed like a great opportunity for another QuickGraph.
Scraping the Itsu website I wrote a couple of Python scripts to download each of the menu items and then extract the product name, description, and allergens.</description>

      <description>Over the last week the Guardian have been counting down their top 100 male footballers of 2019, and on Friday they also published a Google sheet containing all the votes, which seemed like a perfect candidate for a QuickGraph.
We can see a preview of the Google sheet in the printscreen below:
We can also download Google Sheets in CSV format based on the following URI template:
