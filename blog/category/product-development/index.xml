      <description>My colleague Jason Yip recently linked to the Kano Model and although it’s a theory about product development the definition of what counts as a product seems like it can be quite broad.
The best explanation of the model that I’ve come across so far is a post by Jean Claude Grosjean which Frankie linked me to.
Grosjean describes the three types of requirements like so:
Must Have (&amp;#34;Basic needs&amp;#34;) These are not always expressed but they are obvious to the customer and must be met…​[they] are not a source of satisfaction but can cause major disappointment.</description>
