      <title>Retrospectives: An alternative safety check</title>

      <description>At the start of most of the retrospectives I&amp;#8217;ve been part of we&amp;#8217;ve followed the safety check ritual whereby each person participating has to write a number from 1-5 on a sticky describing how they&amp;#8217;ll be participating in the retrospective.
 1 means you&amp;#8217;ll probably keep quiet and not say much, 5 means you&amp;#8217;re perfectly comfortable saying anything and the other numbers fall in between those two extremes.
 In my experiences it&amp;#8217;s a bit of a fruitless exercise because its viewed that a higher number is &#39;better&#39; and therefore the minimum people will tend to write down is &#39;3&#39; because they don&amp;#8217;t want to stand out or cause a problem.</description>

      <title>How we&#39;re using story points</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago Joshua Kerievsky wrote a post describing how he and his teams don&amp;#8217;t use story points anymore because of the problems they&amp;#8217;d had with them which included:
   Story Point Inflation - inflating estimates of stories so that the velocity for an iteration is higher
  Comparing teams by points - judging comparative performance of teams by how many points they&amp;#8217;re able to complete</description>

      <title>Focused Retrospectives: things to watch for</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago a slide deck from an Esther Derby presentation on retrospectives was doing the rounds on twitter and one thing that I found interesting in the deck was the suggestion that a retrospective needs to be focused in some way.
 I&amp;#8217;ve participated in a few focused retrospectives over the past 7/8 months and I think there are some things to be careful about when we decide to focus on something specific rather than just looking back at a time period in general.</description>

      <title>The Language of Risk</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago Chris Matts wrote an interesting blog post &#39;http://theitriskmanager.wordpress.com/2011/12/12/the-language-of-risk/[the language of risk]&#39; in which he describes an approach he used to explain the processes his team uses to an auditor.
  Why did the auditor like what I said? Because I explained everything we did in terms of risk. When they asked for a &amp;#8220;process&amp;#8221;, I explained the risk the process was meant to address. I then explained how our different process addressed the risk more effectively.</description>

      <title>Retrospective: The 5 whys</title>

      <description>Last week my colleague Pat Fornasier ran our team&amp;#8217;s fortnightly retrospective and one of the exercises we did was &#39;the 5 whys&#39;.
 I&amp;#8217;ve always wanted to see how the 5 why&amp;#8217;s would pan out but could never see how you could fit it into a normal retrospective.
 Pat was able to do this by using the data gathered by an earlier timeline exercise where the team had to plot the main events that had happened over the last 6 months.</description>

      <title>Retrospectives: Getting overly focused on actions</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve attended a lot of different retrospectives over the last few years and one thing that seems to happen quite frequently is that a problem will be raised and there will become a massive urgency to find an action to match with that problem.
 As a result of this we don&amp;#8217;t tend to go very deeply into working out why that problem happened in the first place and how we can stop it happening in the first place.</description>

      <description>I facilitated the latest retrospective my team had last week and decided to try The 4 L&amp;#8217;s technique which I&amp;#8217;d come across while browsing the &#39;retrospectives&#39; tag on del.icio.us.
 We had 4 posters around the room representing each of the L&amp;#8217;s:
   Liked
  Learned
  Lacked
  Longed for
   I&amp;#8217;m not really a fan of the majority of a retrospective being dominated by a full group discussion as many people aren&amp;#8217;t comfortable giving their opinions to that many people and therefore end up not participating at all.</description>

      <title>Parkinson&#39;s Law and Iteration Zero</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking a bit about Parkinson&amp;#8217;s Law recently and its&#39; applicability in software development.
 Parkinson&amp;#8217;s law is defined as follows:
  Parkinson&amp;#8217;s Law is the adage first articulated by Cyril Northcote Parkinson as the first sentence of a humorous essay published in The Economist in 1955: &amp;#8220;Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion&amp;#8221;
   My colleagues quite frequently reference this law with respect to stories taking the amount of time that reflects the story point estimate assigned to them.</description>

      <title>Retrospectives: Mini Group Discussions</title>

      <description>One of the approaches that I like the best in retrospectives is when the facilitator splits the team into smaller groups during the brainstorming part of the retrospective.
 I decided to try this out in a retrospective we ran after one week of ThoughtWorks University, using The Retrospective Starfish to provide a framework in which people could frame their thoughts.
 Usually what I&amp;#8217;ve seen happen in these mini groups is that everyone will write down their own ideas on stickies and then discuss them as a group but still put up all the stickies even if the group didn&amp;#8217;t agree with everything.</description>

      <title>Increasing team sizes: Collective unresponsibility</title>

      <description>After a few recent conversations with colleagues as well as my observations of several projects I&amp;#8217;m coming to the conclusion that the way that people react in situations often differs significantly depending on whether they&amp;#8217;re working in a large or small team.
 One of the most obvious ways that this manifests itself is when there comes a need for someone to volunteer to take care of something - be it a particular functional area, communication with the onshore team or something else.</description>

      <title>Increasing team sizes: Boredom</title>

      <description>Although the majority of the teams that I&amp;#8217;ve worked on over the past few years have been relatively small in size I have worked on a few where the team size has been pretty big and perhaps inevitably the productivity has felt much lower.
 I think this is somewhat inevitable since although the overall throughput of these teams may be higher than on smaller teams, due to problems such as having difficulty parallelising work, not every pair is working at maximum productivity.</description>

      <title>Distributed Agile: Stories -  Negotiable</title>
      <link>https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2011/01/24/distributed-agile-stories-negotiable/</link>

      <guid>https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2011/01/24/distributed-agile-stories-negotiable/</guid>
      <description>I was recently reading an article about how to write meaningful user stories and towards the end of it the author mentioned the INVEST acronym which suggests that stories should be:
  Independent
  Negotiable
  Valuable
  Estimable
  Small
  Testable
   From what I&amp;#8217;ve seen the most difficult one to achieve in a distributed context is that stories should be &#39;negotiable&#39;, in particular when it comes to negotiating the way that the UX of a bit of functionality should work.</description>

      <title>Technical implementation heavy stories</title>
      <link>https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2010/12/13/technical-implementation-heavy-stories/</link>

      <guid>https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2010/12/13/technical-implementation-heavy-stories/</guid>
      <description>Earlier this year I wrote about some of the problems that we can run into when we have implicit assumptions in stories and another problematic approach I&amp;#8217;ve seen around this area is where we end up with stories that are very heavily focused on technical implementation.
 Initially this seems like it will work out pretty well since all the developer then needs to do is follow the steps that have been outlined for them but from my experience it seems to create more problems than it solves.</description>

      <title>Increasing team sizes: Parallelising work</title>

      <description>One of the trickiest things to do when working in bigger teams is ensuring that it is possible to parallelise the work we have across the number of pairs that we have available.
 From my experience this problem happens much less frequently in smaller teams. Perhaps inevitably it&amp;#8217;s much easier to find 2 or 3 things that can be worked on in parallel than it is to find 6 or 7 or more.</description>

      <description>Despite being part of numerous retrospectives over the past few years I don&amp;#8217;t remember actually facilitating one until my current team&amp;#8217;s last week.
 I&amp;#8217;ve gradually come to appreciate the skill involved in facilitating this type of meeting having originally been of the opinion that there wasn&amp;#8217;t much to it.
 I recently read Agile Retrospectives which has loads of different ideas for activities beyond just creating &#39;went well&#39; and &#39;could improve&#39; columns and then filling those in as a group.</description>

      <guid>https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2010/11/14/agile-increasing-team-sizes/</guid>
      <description>A fairly common trend on nearly every project I&amp;#8217;ve worked on is that at some stage the client will ask for more people to be added to the team in order to &#39;improve&#39; the velocity.
 Some of the most common arguments against doing so are that it will initially slow down the team&amp;#8217;s velocity as the new members learn the domain, code base and get to know the other members of the team.</description>

      <description>Following on from my blog post about some observations about the actions that we create in retrospectives I&amp;#8217;ve also noticed some general ways that retrospectives might not end up being as useful as we&amp;#8217;d hope.
 Having a manager facilitating While having the manager of the team facilitating the retrospective isn&amp;#8217;t a problem in itself I think it&amp;#8217;s useful to remember that in this context they aren&amp;#8217;t in that role anymore.</description>

      <description>My colleague Ashwin Raghav wrote a blog post earlier in the week in which he noted some patterns that he&amp;#8217;s noticed in retrospectives in his time working in ThoughtWorks.
 In it he talks quite generally about things he&amp;#8217;s noticed but in my experience one of the areas in which teams typically struggle is when it comes to action items.
 Too many action items I think this is probably the number one mistake that we make in retrospectives and it&amp;#8217;s really easy to make.</description>

      <description>I wrote earlier in the week about the benefits of having a physical story wall on a distributed team and in the process of getting one in place on the project we learnt a few things that I&amp;#8217;d previously taken for granted.
 All the work in one place We initially started off by having stories on one part of the wall, bugs on another part and any technical tasks stored in Mingle somewhere.</description>

      <description>I recently came across quite an interesting post written by Steve Garnett where he discusses the difference between constraints and impediments inside organisations.
 He comes to the following conclusion:
  For me, the difference between an impediment and a constraint is whether the individual, team, organisation, enterprise, or industry considers the obstacle as removable. If whoever is working with the obstacle believes it can be removed then it is considered an impediment, if the same person doesn&amp;#8217;t not believe it can be removed, or doesn&amp;#8217;t wish to work towards it&amp;#8217;s removal, it&amp;#8217;s considered a constraint.</description>

      <description>Something which can often happen with agile software development teams is that in the desire to take everyone&amp;#8217;s opinion into account for every decision we end up having a lot of meetings.
 Toni wrote about this a while ago and described a situation where he&amp;#8217;d managed to get rid of a meeting and just have a discussion after the stand up with the necessary people.
 While this is a good idea I still think there are occasions where it&amp;#8217;s not necessary to discuss every problem down to the minute details with the whole team.</description>

      <description>On the majority of the projects that I&amp;#8217;ve worked on at ThoughtWorks we&amp;#8217;ve held a showcase at the end of each iteration to show our client what we&amp;#8217;ve been working on and finished over the previous one or two weeks.
 The format of these showcases has been fairly similar each time but the people who attended has tended to vary depending on the situation.
 As part of the project being worked on at ThoughtWorks University we&amp;#8217;ve run a showcase at the end of each week which the whole team have been attending.</description>

      <description>I recently came across an interesting post about pair programming by Paritosh Ranjan where he outlines some of the problems he&amp;#8217;s experienced with this practice.
 While some of the points that he raises are certainly valid I think they&amp;#8217;re more evidence of pair programming not being done in an effective way rather than a problem with the idea in itself.
 To take one example:
  Generally people don&amp;#8217;t think a lot while pair programming as the person who wants to think about the pros and cons will be considered inefficient (as he will slow down the coding speed).</description>

      <description>Ken Schwaber recently wrote a blog post where he compared the differences between the kanban, lean and scrum approaches to software development and although I haven&amp;#8217;t had the same experiences as he has with the first two, one interesting thing he implies is that with a scrum approach we have slack time built in.
  God help us. People found ways to have slack in waterfall, to rest and be creative.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve worked on two different teams this year which had quite different approaches to retrospectives.
 In the first team we had a retrospective at the beginning of every iteration i.e. once every two weeks and in the second team we tried out the idea of having a rolling retrospective i.e. we put up potential retrospective items on the wall and when there were enough of those we discussed them in the standup.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve previously written about the danger of using velocity as a goal but on almost every project I&amp;#8217;ve worked on at some stage we do actually end up chasing a points total.
 Something I find quite interesting towards the end of an iteration is that if there is a choice of two stories to pick up then the project manager will nearly always press for one which can be completed within the remaining time in order to get the points total for that iteration higher.</description>

      <title>Agile: Slimming down stories</title>

      <description>On the project I&amp;#8217;m currently working on we have several stories around writing the code that does various different calculations based on user input and then shows the results on the screen.
 The original assumption on these stories was that we would be looking up the data of the business rules from a local database. The data would be copied across from a central database into that one for this project.</description>

      <description>Grant Joung wrote a post a while ago about velocity goals and whether they&amp;#8217;re a good or bad idea, a topic which seems to come up from time to time on agile teams.
 My colleague Danilo Sato previously wrote about the dangers of using velocity as a performance measure because it&amp;#8217;s something that&amp;#8217;s directly within our control and can therefore be gamed:
  Value should be measured at the highest level possible, so that it doesn&amp;#8217;t fall into one team&amp;#8217;s (or individual&amp;#8217;s) span of control.</description>

      <description>My colleague J.K. has written an interesting blog post where he describes a slightly different approach that he&amp;#8217;s been taking to writing stories to help move the business value in a story towards the beginning of the description and avoid detailing a solution in the &#39;I want&#39; section of the story.
 To summarise, J.K.&#39;s current approach involves moving from the traditional story format of:
 As I... I want.. So that.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve spent most of my time working on agile software development teams over the last few years so for the most part each pair is only working on one story, keeping the work in progress low and allowing them to focus on that piece of work until it&amp;#8217;s completed.
 My pair and I ended up in a therefore somewhat unusual situation last week where we were attempting to work on three things at the same time and weren&amp;#8217;t doing a particularly great job on any of them.</description>

      <title>Requirements: The story points focus</title>

      <description>Something which an agile approach on a project typically gives us is the ability to change requirements rapidly based on the different types of feedback we typically get over the course of the project.
 One way that we can lose this advantage is by getting caught up by the number of story points being completed and using this as the measure of success.
 The flexibility to change has an impact on the number of story points that may be completed in a given iteration - if we start doing some work on a story and then get feedback from the business while it is still in progress it&amp;#8217;s possible that we will end up with more work to do than we had previously.</description>

      <title>Lean: Big Picture over Local Optimisations</title>

      <description>I recently finished reading Lean Thinking and one of the things that was repeatedly emphasised is the need to look at the process as a whole rather than trying to optimise each part individually.
 If we phrased this in a similar way to the Agile Manifesto it would probably read &#39;Big Picture over Local Optimisations&#39;.
 The examples in Lean Thinking tend to be more manufacturing focused but I think this idea can certainly be applied in thinking about software projects too.</description>

      <title>Agile: Re-estimating cards</title>

      <guid>https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2009/02/11/agile-re-estimating-cards/</guid>
      <description>Chris Johnston has another interesting post in which he writes about the practice of re-estimating cards after they have been completed.
 I think this somewhat misses the point that the estimate is indeed supposed to be an estimate. It might turn out to be too optimistic or too pessimistic, the theory being that overall we will end up with a reasonable balance that will allow us to make a prediction on how much work we believe we can complete in a certain time period.</description>

      <description>My colleague Chris Johnston wrote recently about his experiences in agile software development, posing some questions that he has.
 Specifically:
   Why comments are evil?
  Why design is evil?
  Why must you pair all the time?
  Why Agile principles become Agile rules?
   Now I&amp;#8217;m assuming that most (if not all) of Chris&#39; experiences with agile have been at ThoughtWorks, in which case the mix of agile we use on our projects tends to be a combination of Scrum and Extreme Programming.</description>

      <title>Agile: Why do we integrate early?</title>

      <description>One of the inevitabilities of most projects is that at some stage there is going to need be some sort of integration.
 The likes of Alistair Cockburn in Crystal Clear and Andy Hunt/Dave Thomas in The Pragmatic Programmer talk of the need to do integration early rather than letting it wait until later, but why?
 Get the pain out the way To some degree every time we try to integrate there is going to be some level of pain - for me it therefore makes sense that we take this pain early on when we have the chance to do something about it rather than leaving it until later and being surprised at the problems it causes.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve worked on a few different agile projects and one of the things that hasn&amp;#8217;t been completely consistent is when we consider a story to be &#39;done&#39;.
 There seem to a few different approaches, each of which has its benefits and drawbacks.
 Why do we care? We care about &#39;done&#39; for tracking the points we have achieved in an iteration and for knowing when we have added the value the story provides.</description>

      <title>Agile: Some misconceptions</title>

      <guid>https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2008/12/31/agile-some-misconceptions/</guid>
      <description>I came across an interesting article written for Visual Studio Magazine about agile methodologies where the author makes what I consider to be some misconceptions.
 The first is around the level of experience of people working on an agile team:
  For example, agile teams have a tendency to require a high level of experience and professionalism just to join the team.
   I wouldn&amp;#8217;t say I have a high level of experience and I&amp;#8217;ve been working on agile teams for the past two years, just one data point suggesting that this statement is not actually accurate.</description>

      <description>While reading The Toyota Way one of the ideas which stood out for me was the constant mentioning of organisations which picked bits of The Toyota Way, implemented them, achieved some short term gains but then eventually these improvements and went back to the way they were before.
 I noticed a similar theme coming out in the series of posts in the last week or so about the decline of agile.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s the seemingly small details of the agile/XP approach to software development that make it so much more effective than the traditional approach.
 I was reminded of this last week with regards to having co-located teams with the developers, BAs, QAs and the business people all sitting in close proximity.
 I was working on the auto completion function for one of our screens and the QA on the team, who was sitting next to me, asked me if I could look through the acceptance criteria that he was working on.</description>

      <description>One of the common trends I have noticed in the stand ups of teams which practice pair programming is that very often the first person in the pair describes what they have been working on and what they will be doing today and then when it comes to the other person they say &#39;ditto&#39;.
 After I dittoed one too many times on a project earlier this year it was pointed out to me that this was not a valuable way of contributing to the weekend and that I should describe my view of our progress as it may differ to my pair.</description>

      <description>In my final year of university a few years ago when I was applying for jobs I was really keen to join the (then) Reuters Graduate Technology program.
 The thing that appealed to me the most was that over the 2 years you were on the graduate program you would have the opportunity to be placed in 4 different roles within the business.	The website gives some examples:
  Technical architect, Project manager, Infrastructure service manager, Business analyst, Product &amp;amp; development manager, Software engineer, Implementation engineer, Desktop design consultant, Technical specialist, Deployment project manager, Training</description>

      <description>While reading Marc&amp;#8217;s post about the Customer or Client naming dilemma I was reminded of another situation I have noticed in software development - the Client/User dilemma.
 From my experience of agile projects it tends to be much more likely that we can get easy access to our client than to the users of the system we are writing.
 Alistair Cockburn mentions in Crystal Clear that having an expert user sit with the team can be very useful, but it is not something that I have experienced on all the projects that I have worked on.</description>

      <description>The last two projects that I&amp;#8217;ve worked on I&amp;#8217;ve been on the project from right near the start, and one thing that&amp;#8217;s been consistent in both projects is that we&amp;#8217;ve spent time early on in the project trying to reduce technical risk.
 In my most recent project this has involved getting infrastructure in place early on, and in the previous one it involved working on technical spikes for several weeks to prove that what the client was asking for was actually technically possible.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve never worked on a distributed or offshore project before, but intrigued having read about Jay Fields&#39; experiences I attended the &#39;OffShoring: The Current State of Play&#39; Quarterly Technology Briefing held this morning in Sydney to hear the other side of the argument.
 The underlying message for me was that a lot of the concepts we apply for onshore projects are equally important for offshore projects.
 Forrester&amp;#8217;s Tim Sheedy started off by providing some research data on the state of IT offshoring, some reasons he had identified around which type of work should be offshored before closing on some reasons that it might fail if not done correctly.</description>

      <description>Gojko Adzic posted a summary of a talk James Surowiecki gave at Agile 2008 and it got me thinking how we use the Wisdom of Crowds in Agile projects.
 One of the most interesting things I learnt from the book is that when you bring together a diverse group of people, their output will probably be better than any one expert. Gojko points out this example that was used at Agile 2008:</description>

 When doing this it appeared clear that there were two situations that we were trying to avoid:
 Under estimating Under estimating is where we predict that the amount of time taken to complete a piece of work will be less than it actually is.</description>

      <description>I touched earlier on the transparency of agile and I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about some of the ways that we track/report information in agile projects.
 In all the projects I&amp;#8217;ve been involved in the data being tracked almost exclusively referred to development time. One of the advantages of having continuous analysis/development/testing is that we are able to reduce the time spent on the System Integration and User Acceptance Testing phases of the project.</description>

      <description>One of the key ideas behind agile software development is providing information as early as possible to allow the business to best make decisions.
 There are a variety of ways that this is done including the use of burn up charts, estimates of scope and velocity for example. This data is compiled to try and give an accurate idea of how long a project is likely to take so that the business can work out early on whether the value it adds is worth the expected cost.</description>
