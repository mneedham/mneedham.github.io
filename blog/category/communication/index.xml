      <title>Product Documentation: The receiver decides if it&#39;s successful</title>

      <description>One of the things I remember being taught while growing up is that in an interaction where somebody is something to someone else it&amp;#8217;s their responsibility to do so in a way that the receiver can understand.
 Even if you think you&amp;#8217;ve done a good job of explaining something, the receiver of the communication decides whether or not that&amp;#8217;s the case.
 I&amp;#8217;d always assumed that this advice made most sense in the context of a one to one conversation but recently I&amp;#8217;ve realised that it also makes sense when thinking about product documentation.</description>

      <title>Presentations; Tell a story</title>

      <description>A few years ago before an F# talk that I gave at the .NET user group in Sydney my colleague Erik Doernenburg gave me some advice about how I should structure the talk.
 (paraphrasing)
  He suggested that in a lot of talks he&amp;#8217;d seen the presenter rattle off a bunch of information about a topic but hadn&amp;#8217;t provided any insight into their own experience with the topic. If two people give a talk on the same topic they therefore end up being fairly similar talks even though each person may have a totally different perspective.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a really cool blog post by Dr Nic titled &#39;http://drnicwilliams.com/2011/11/11/how-to-stop-killing-people-with-your-public-speeches/[How to stop killing people with your public speeches]&#39; where he talks about the importance of practicing our presentations so that they actually make an impact on our audience.
 Towards the end of the post he suggests joining Toastmasters as a useful first step for getting used to speaking to a group of people and as an added bonus you get feedback after each speech you give.</description>

      <title>The ladder of inference</title>

      <description>In Discussing the Undiscussable William Noonan describes the ladder of inference, a tool which can be used to help us achieve double loop learning with respect to our interactions with other people.
  Ladder of Inference helps people identify what information or facts are used as the basis for their reasoning process. It also helps people understand how they interpret that information and how they apply their interpretation to the issue or problem at hand.</description>

      <title>Use of language: Intuitive</title>

      <description>Sumeet and I were recently discussing the difference between the use of Google Groups for internal communication compared to the Jive platform which we&amp;#8217;re now moving to and I suggested that I found the former more intuitive to use.
 Sumeet suggested that the word &#39;intuitive&#39; is quite overloaded and later pointed me to an article on the Moodle website which advocates the same thing:
  Intuitive is a word you should avoid in discussions of usability as its meaning is often confused.</description>

      <title>Pecha Kucha: My first attempt</title>

      <description>The first time I came across the Pecha Kucha style of presenting was at the XP 2010 conference during the Agile Suitcase session where Pat Kua and some others talked about the practices, principles and values they most favoured.
 I&amp;#8217;ve never done one before but as part of the preparation work for ThoughtWorks University each of the trainers had to prepare one which we then presented to each other yesterday.</description>

      <title>Espoused theory, theory in action &amp; hypocrisy </title>

      <description>Earlier in the year I wrote about Chris Argyris&#39; espoused theory and theory in action and one of the interesting aspects to it which I hadn&amp;#8217;t previously considered is how we treat people when their espoused theory and theory in action don&amp;#8217;t match.
 My tendency is to think that these people are hypocrites but Benjamin Mitchell pointed out in a conversation on twitter that it&amp;#8217;s not really helpful to think that way:</description>

      <description>I realised a couple of weeks ago while pairing with a colleague that I&amp;#8217;ve become quite bad at interrupting people while they&amp;#8217;re speaking.
 I did have an inkling that I&amp;#8217;d let my ability to properly listen to someone drift a bit but I hadn&amp;#8217;t seen any evidence until my colleague pointed it out.
 Somewhat ironically I actually wrote a post about active listening when I first started working at ThoughtWorks in 2006 and reading back over the listening barriers that I listed I realise that there are a few that I tend to break:</description>

      <title>&#39;Why&#39; often unhelpful</title>
      <link>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2011/02/03/why-often-unhelpful/</link>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2011/02/03/why-often-unhelpful/</guid>
      <description>Something which I&amp;#8217;ve noticed recently in particular when interviewing people but also in some other situations is that frequently posing a question which begins with &#39;why&#39; results in quite a defensive response.
 While discussing this with Priyank he pointed out that asking a question in this way can often be construed as a criticism of the idea being questioned.
 Admittedly it is often the case that I&amp;#8217;m questioning something which has been done differently than what I might have done but I&amp;#8217;m still curious as to the reasoning behind it.</description>

      <title>While in India: Osmotic communication</title>

      <description>One of the things that has been puzzling me during my time in India is the amount of time that is spent in meetings pushing information to people rather than them pulling it.
 In previous projects that I&amp;#8217;ve worked on a lot of the knowledge was moved between around as a result of osmotic communication
  Osmotic communication means that information flows into the background hearing of members of the team, so that they pick up relevant information as though by osmosis.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been reading some of the articles written about the disruption caused by the snow across Europe and I found one quote in The Daily Telegraph by Phillip Hammond particularly interesting
  &#34;I think whilst people are obviously deeply upset about the inconvenience, particularly at this time of year, of having their travel plans disrupted, most of what I am hearing is a sense of outrage about the way they were then treated when they were stranded at Heathrow airport.</description>

      <description>One of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve noticed in several of the &#39;agile&#39; communication mechanisms (such as the standup or dev huddle) that we typically use on teams is that they focus almost entirely on verbal communication which only covers one of our learning styles - the auditory learning style.
 The Learning Models The VAK learning style model describes a simple model covering the different learning styles that people have:

      <description>As I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned on twitter a few times my current team has a lot of meetings and apart from using the passive aggressive approach that Toby Tripp&amp;#8217;s meeting ticker provides I&amp;#8217;ve also been flicking through Chapter 19, &#39;Guerilla Collaboration&#39;, of Jean Tabaka&amp;#8217;s &#39;http://www.amazon.com/Collaboration-Explained-Facilitation-Software-Project/dp/0321268776/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1288536162&amp;amp;sr=8-1[Collaboration Explained: Facilitation skills for software project leaders]&#39; which gives other ideas.
 I&amp;#8217;ve also seen some useful ideas that my colleagues have used in meetings that I&amp;#8217;ve been part of.</description>

      <description>I think one of the most important skills to perfect when communicating with other people is to understand the level of detail that we need to be speaking at, something my colleague Ashwin Raghav refers to as our logging level.
 We log various things in our code at varying logging levels ranging from &#39;error&#39; through &#39;debug&#39; to &#39;warn&#39;, and each of these is useful for understanding what our code is doing.</description>

      <title>Builders hanging off class vs Builders in same namespace</title>
      <link>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2009/08/15/builders-hanging-off-class-vs-builders-in-same-namespace/</link>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2009/08/15/builders-hanging-off-class-vs-builders-in-same-namespace/</guid>
      <description>I wrote a couple of months ago about an approach we&amp;#8217;re using to help people find test data builders in our code base by hanging those builders off a class called &#39;GetBuilderFor&#39; and I think it&amp;#8217;s worked reasonably well.
 However, a couple of weeks ago my colleague Lu Ning suggested another way to achieve our goal of allowing people to find the builders easily.
 The approach he suggested is to put all of the builders in the same namespace, for example &#39;Builders&#39;, so that if someone wants to find out if a builder already exists they can just type &#39;Builders.</description>

      <title>Coding: Putting code where people can find it</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve previously written about the builder pattern which I think is a very useful pattern for helping to setup data.
 It allows us to setup custom data when we care about a specific piece of data in a test or just use default values if we&amp;#8217;re not bothered about a piece of data but need it to be present for our test to execute successfully.
 One problem that I noticed was that despite the fact we had builders for quite a number of the classes we were using in our tests, when new tests were being added test data was still being setup by directly using the classes instead of making use of the builders which had already done the hard work for you.</description>

      <title>Adding humour to Tester/Developer collaboration</title>

      <description>Pat Kua has a recent post where he talks about the language used between testers and developers when talking about defects that testers come across when testing some functionality and while I would agree with him that the language used is important, I&amp;#8217;ve always found that injecting some humour into the situation takes the edge off.
 As Dahlia points out I think this is probably only possible if there is good rapport between the developers and testers on the team so perhaps this has been the case for the teams I&amp;#8217;ve worked on.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been reading Neal Ford&amp;#8217;s The Productive Programmer (my review) which is a book all about improving your productivity as an individual developer.
 It got me thinking that there are also ways that we can make teams more productive so that they are actually teams and not just a group of individuals who happen to work with each other.
 I&amp;#8217;ve had the opportunity of working under some great Tech Leads who have helped create an environment where teams can perform to their maximum.</description>

      <description>Gojko Adzic posted a summary of a talk James Surowiecki gave at Agile 2008 and it got me thinking how we use the Wisdom of Crowds in Agile projects.
 One of the most interesting things I learnt from the book is that when you bring together a diverse group of people, their output will probably be better than any one expert. Gojko points out this example that was used at Agile 2008:</description>

      <description>Sometimes the simplest things can provide the greatest value to project teams. We often look for a technical solution to problems where something simpler would achieve the same aim.
 The Information Wall is as its name may suggest a place where you can put information that people in the team need to know but which they have not (yet) committed to memory.
 Examples of things that you could put on an information wall could be:</description>

      <description>One of the first unusual (to me) things that I noticed from the trainers at ThoughtWorks University was that when they were listening to participants they would often ask questions and re-frame the participants&#39; comments. Intrigued and impressed by this I spoke to one of the trainers and was told that they were engaging in &#39;active listening&#39;. Wikipedia defines the term as follows:
     Active listening is an intent &#34;</description>
