      <description>If we want two Docker containers to communicate with each other they need to belong to the same network. In this post we&amp;#8217;ll learn how to find out the network of existing containers so that we can attach new containers to that network.
 All the containers mentioned in this post can be launched locally from Docker compose, using the following command:
 git clone git@github.com:mneedham/ksql-kafka-neo4j-streams.git &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd ksql-kafka-neo4j-streams docker-compose-up   Running this command will create four containers:</description>

      <description>I was playing around with Docker locally and somehow ended up with this error when I tried to list my docker machines:
 $ docker-machine ls NAME ACTIVE DRIVER STATE URL SWARM DOCKER ERRORS default - virtualbox Running tcp://192.168.99.101:2376 Unknown Unable to query docker version: Get https://192.168.99.101:2376/v1.15/version: x509: certificate is valid for 192.168.99.100, not 192.168.99.101   My Google Fu was weak I couldn&amp;#8217;t find any suggestions for what this might mean so I tried shutting it down and starting it again!</description>
