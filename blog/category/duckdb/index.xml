      <description>In this blog post we’re going to learn how to build an application to compare the matches between two ATP tennis players. DuckDB and Streamlit will be our partners in crime for this mission.
Set up To get started, let’s create a virtual environment:
python -m venv .venv source .venv/bin/activate And now install some libraries:
pip install duckdb streamlit streamlit-searchbox And now let’s open a file, app.py and import the packages:</description>

      <description>I’ve been playing around with DuckDB over the weekend and ran into an interesting problem while using the Relational API in the Python package. We’re going to explore that in this blog post.
Set up To get started, let’s install DuckDB:
pip install duckdb And now let’s open a Python shell and import the package:
import duckdb Next, let’s create a DuckDB connection and import the httpfs module, which we’ll use in just a minute:</description>

      <description>In this blog post we’re going to learn how to write a SQL query to join two tables where one of the tables has multiple rows for each key. We want to select only the rows that contain the most recent (or maximum) value from that table.
Our story begins with a YouTube video that I created showing how to query the European Soccer SQLite database with DuckDB. This database contains lots of different tables, but we are only interested in Player and Player_Attributes.</description>
