      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to see the error in approach if there is an approach! On one occasion where I hadn&amp;rsquo;t planned out an approach I ended up staring at the question for 10 minutes and didn&amp;rsquo;t make any progress at all.
e.g. one exercise was to calculate the 5th percentile of a posterior distribution which I flailed around with for 15 minutes before giving up. Watching back on the video it was obvious that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t completely understood what a probability mass functionwas.</description>
