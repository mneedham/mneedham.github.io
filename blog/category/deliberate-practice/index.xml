      <description>A few weeks ago I wrote about the learning to cycle dependency graph which described some of the skills required to become proficient at riding a bike.
While we’ve been practicing various skills/sub skills I’ve often found myself saying the following:
if it’s not hard you’re not practicing me, April 2015
i.e. you should find the skill you’re currently practicing difficult otherwise you’re not stretching yourself and therefore aren’t getting better.</description>

      <description>I’ve recently been reading the literature written by K. Anders Eriksson and co on Deliberate Practice and one of the suggestions for increasing our competence at a skill is to put ourselves in a situation where we can fail.
I’ve been reading Think Bayes - an introductory text on Bayesian statistics, something I know nothing about - and each chapter concludes with a set of exercises to practice, a potentially perfect exercise in failure!</description>
