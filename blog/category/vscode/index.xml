      <description>(Co-authored with Michael Hunger)
Venkat Subramaniam is a legendary speaker on the tech conference circuit whose presentations are famous for executing arbitrary code snippets and showing the results as a tooltip directly in the editor. This makes it really great for videos or talks as you don’t need a second output terminal to run your code and you can just continue explaining what you’re doing. The results go away afterwards, so you don’t need to worry about that.</description>
