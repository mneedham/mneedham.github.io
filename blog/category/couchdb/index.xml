      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with the Twitter streaming APIa bit lately to see which links are being posted most frequently by the people I follow and then storing the appropriate tweets in CouchDB.
I recently came across a problem which I struggled to solve for quite a while.
Based on the following map function:
{ &amp;#34;_id&amp;#34; : &amp;#34;_design/query&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;views&amp;#34; : { &amp;#34;by_link&amp;#34; : { &amp;#34;map&amp;#34; : &amp;#34;function(doc){ emit(doc.actual_link, { user : doc.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with CouchDBagain in my annual attempt to capture the links appearing on my twitter stream and I managed to create the following error for myself:
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5984/twitter_links/_design/cleanup/_view/find_broken_links {&amp;#34;error&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;badmatch&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;reason&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;{\n \&amp;#34;find_broken_links\&amp;#34;: {\n \&amp;#34;map\&amp;#34;: \&amp;#34;function(doc) { \nvar prefix = doc.actual_link.match(/.*/); \n if(true) { emit(doc.actual_link, null); } }\&amp;#34;\n }\n}&amp;#34;} It turns out this error is because I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to create new line characters in the view while editing it inside CouchDBX.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my previous postI&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with CouchDBand one of the problems that I&amp;rsquo;ve been having is that although I can access my database through the REST API perfectly fine, whenever I went to the Futonpage (&amp;lsquo;http://localhost:5984/_utils/&amp;rsquo; in my case) to view my list of databases I was getting the following javascript error:
Database information could not be retrieved: missing I thought I&amp;rsquo;d have a quick look with FireBug to see if I could work out what was going on and saw several requests being made to the following urls and resulting in 404s:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with CouchDBa bit today and in particular making use of SharpCouch, a library which acts as a wrapper around CouchDB calls. It is included in the CouchBrowselibrary which is recommended as a good starting point for interacting with CouchDB from C# code.
I decided to work out how the API worked with by writing an integration test to save a document to the database.
The API is reasonably easy to understand and I ended up with the following test:</description>
