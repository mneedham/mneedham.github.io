      <description>I was working my way through some of the exercises in SICP over the weekend and one that I found particularly interesting was 1.11 where you have to write a function by means of a recursive process and then by means of an iterative process.
A function f is defined by the rule that f(n) = n if n&amp;lt;3 and f(n) = f(n - 1) + 2f(n - 2) + 3f(n - 3) if n&amp;gt; 3.</description>
