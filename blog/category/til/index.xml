      <title>GitHub: Get a CSV containing my pull requests (PRs)</title>
      <link>https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2023/06/12/github-list-pull-requests-csv/</link>

      <description>I wanted to get a list of my GitHub pull requests (PRs) and commits, which was surprisingly difficult to figure out how to do. I’m sure it must be possible to get this data from the API, but it was a lot easier to figure out how to do so with the GitHub CLI.
So I installed that and it had be authorise via the GitHub website the first time.</description>

      <title>Creating LinkedIn Carousel/Slides</title>

      <description>If you’ve been using LinkedIn recently, you’ve likely seen those posts where people post slides in a kind of carousel that you can horizontally scroll. I wanted to create one to explain Apache Pinot’s Upserts feature, but I wasn’t sure how to create one.
Since it’s 2023, I started by asking ChatGPT:
Figure 1. ChatGPT doesn’t know about LinkedIn Carousel Unfortunately ChatGPT doesn’t know how to do it, but Harrison Avisto does and was happy to teach me.</description>

      <title>DuckDB/SQL: Pivot - 0 if null</title>

      <description>I’ve been learning all about the PIVOT function that was recently added in DuckDB and I ran into an issue where lots of the cells in my post PIVOT table were null values. In this blog post, we’ll learn how to replace those nulls with 0s (or indeed any other value).
Setup I’m working with Jeff Sackmann’s tennis dataset, which I loaded by running the following query:
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE matches AS SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto( list_transform( range(1968, 2023), y -&amp;gt; &amp;#39;https://raw.</description>

      <description>I’ve been trying out the Running Pinot in Kubernetes tutorial and ran into a problem trying to write data to Kafka. In this blog we’ll explore how I got around that problem.
I’m using Helm with Kubernetes and started a Kafka service by running the following:
helm repo add kafka https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami helm install -n pinot-quickstart kafka kafka/kafka --set replicas=1,zookeeper.image.tag=latest I waited until the service had started and then ran the following command to port forward the Kafka service’s port 9092 to port 9092 on my host OS:</description>

      <description>I’m still playing around with data returned by Apache Pinot’s HTTP API and I wanted to sort a dictionary of segment names by partition id and index. In this blog post we’re going to look into how to do that.
We’ll start with the following dictionary:
segments = { &amp;#34;events3__4__1__20230605T1335Z&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;CONSUMED&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;events3__4__13__20230605T1335Z&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;CONSUMED&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;events3__4__20__20230605T1335Z&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;CONSUMING&amp;#34; } As I mentioned above, I want to sort the dictionary’s items by partition id and index, which are embedded inside the key name.</description>

      <title>Python: Padding a string</title>

      <description>I’ve been writing some scripts to parse data from Apache Pinot’s HTTP API and I wanted to format the values stored in a map to make them more readable. In this blog post, we’ll look at some ways that I did that.
I started with a map that looked a bit like this:
segments = { &amp;#34;events3__4__1__20230605T1335Z&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;CONSUMED&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;events3__4__20__20230605T1335Z&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;CONSUMING&amp;#34; } And then I iterated over and printed each item like this:</description>

      <title>DuckDB: Ingest a bunch of CSV files from GitHub</title>

      <description>Jeff Sackmann’s tennis_atp repository is one of the best collections of tennis data and I wanted to ingest the ATP Tour singles matches using the DuckDB CLI. In this blog post we’ll learn how to do that.
Usually when I’m ingesting data into DuckDB I’ll specify the files that I want to ingest using the wildcard syntax. In this case that would mean running a query like this:
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE matches AS SELECT * FROM &amp;#34;https://raw.</description>

      <title>DuckDB/SQL: Create a list of numbers</title>

      <description>While in DuckDB land, I wanted to create a list of numbers, just like you can with Cypher’s range function. After a bit of searching that resulted in very complex solutions, I came across the Postgres generate_series function, which does the trick.
We can use it in place of a table, like this:
SELECT * FROM generate_series(1, 10); Table 1. Output generate_series 1

      <title>Cropping a video using FFMPEG</title>

      <description>I needed to crop a video that I used as part of a video on my YouTube channel, Learn Data With Mark, and Camtasia kept rendering a black screen. So I had to call for FFMPEG!
Cropping the bottom of a video My initial video was 2160 x 3840 but I didn’t need the bottom 1920 pixels because I’m using that part of the screen for a video of me.</description>

      <title>Python: Naming slices</title>
      <link>https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2023/05/13/python-naming-slices/</link>

      <description>Another gem from Fluent Python is that you can name slices. How did I not know that?!
Let’s have a look how it works using an example of a Vehicle Identification Number, which has 17 characters that act as a unique identifier for a vehicle. Different parts of that string mean different things.
So given the following VIN:
vin = &amp;#34;2B3HD46R02H210893&amp;#34; We can extract components like this:
print(f&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; World manufacturer identifier: {vin[0:3]} Vehicle Descriptor: {vin[3:9]} Vehicle Identifier: {vin[9:17]} &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;.</description>

      <title>Python 3.10: Pattern matching with match/case</title>

      <description>I’ve been reading Fluent Python and learnt about pattern matching with the match/case statement, introduced in Python 3.10. You can use it instead of places where you’d otherwise use if, elif, else statements.
I created a small example to understand how it works. The following function takes in a list where the first argument should be foo, followed by a variable number of arguments, which we print to the console:</description>
