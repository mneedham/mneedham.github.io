      <description>In my continued playing around with the Strava API, I wanted to write a script to download all of my Strava activities to a JSON file.
 As I mentioned in a previous blog post, the approach to authenticating requests has changed in the last two years, so we first need to generate an access token via the OAuth endpoint. Luckily Odd Eirik Igland shared a script showing how to solve most of the problem, and I&amp;#8217;ve adapted it to do what I want.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m revisiting the Strava API after a two year absence and the approach to authenticating requests has changed in that time. You now need to generate an access token via OAuth 2.0, as described in the &#39;How to authenticate with OAuth 2.0&#39; section of the Getting Started with the Strava API guide.
 I want to generate a token that lets me retrieve all of my activities via the /athlete/activities end point.</description>
