title="Exploring (potential) data entry errors in the Land Registry data set"
tag=['data-science-2']
category=['Data Science']
+++

<p>
I've previously written a couple of blog posts describing the mechanics of analysing the <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/land-registry-monthly-price-paid-data">Land Registry data set</a> and I thought it was about time I described some of the queries I've been running the discoveries I've made.
</p>


<p>To recap, the land registry provides a 3GB, 20 million line CSV file containing all the property sales in the UK since 1995.
</p>


<p>We'll be loading and query the data in R using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html">data.table</a> package:</p>

<p>
For our first query we're going to find the most expensive query sold for each year from 1995 - 2015.
</p>


<p>
The first thing we'll need to do is make column 'V2' (price) numeric and convert column 'V3' (sale date) to data format so we can do date arithmetic on it:
</p>



~~~r

> dt = dt[, V2:= as.numeric(V2)]
> dt = dt[, V3:= as.Date(V3)]
~~~

<p>Now let's write the query:</p>



~~~r

> dt[, .SD[which.max(V2)], by=year(V3)][order(year)][, .(year,V9,V8,V10,V12,V14,V4,V2)]

<p>The results mostly make sense - the majority of the highest priced properties are around Hyde Park and often somewhere near Knightsbridge which is one of the most expensive places in the country.
</p>


<p>There are some odd odds though. e.g. in 1996 the top priced property is in Leicester and sold for just over £17m. I looked it up on the Land Registry site to quickly see what it was <a href="http://houseprices.landregistry.gov.uk/price-paid-record/1943130/24+main+road+asfordby+valley+melton+mowbray+melton+leicestershire+le14+3sp">subsequently sold for</a>:
</p>


<div>

<img src="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015-10-17_22-06-03.png" alt="2015 10 17 22 06 03" title="2015-10-17_22-06-03.png" border="0" width="500" /></div>

<p>
Based on the subsequent prices I think we can safely assume that the initial price is incorrect and should actually have been £17,250.
</p>


<p>We can also say the same about our 2000 winner in Juniper Park in Basildon which sold for £12.6 million. If we look at the <a href="http://houseprices.landregistry.gov.uk/sold-prices/juniper%20park%20ss15%206rz">next sale price after that</a> it's £172,500 in 2003 so most likely it was sold for £126,000 - only 100 times out!
</p>


<p>
I wanted to follow this observation and see if I could find other anomalies by comparing adjacent sale prices of properties.
</p>


<p>
First we'll create a 'fullAddress' field which we'll use as an identifier for each property. It's not completely unique but it's not far away:
</p>



~~~r

> dt = dt[, fullAddress := paste(dt$V8, dt$V9, dt$V10, dt$V11, dt$V12, dt$V13, dt$V4, sep=", ")]
> setkey(dt, fullAddress)

> dt[, .(fullAddress, V2)][1:5]
                                                                                  fullAddress     V2

<p>
Next we'll add a column to the data table which contains the previous sale price and another column which calculate the difference between the two prices:
</p>



~~~R

<p>
Most of the entries here are in Westminster or Hyde Park and don't look particularly dodgy at first glance. We'd have to drill into the sale dates to confirm.
</p>


<p>What you might also have noticed is that our Melton Mowbray and Juniper Park properties both show up and although they don't have the biggest £ value difference they would probably rank top if calculated the multiplier instead. Let's give that a try:</p>

This is much better!  Our Melton Mowbray property comes in first by miles and Juniper Park is there in 4th. The rest of the price increases look implausible as well but let's drill into a couple of them:

<p>
If we look at some other properties on the <a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/house-prices/WN7/Brewery-Lane.html">same road</a> and look at the <a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/house-prices/detailMatching.html?prop=18993944&sale=35286620&country=england">property's features</a> it seems more likely that's meant to say £88,000.
</p>


<p>
I noticed a similar trend when looking at some of the others on this list but I also realised that the data needs a bit of cleaning up as the 'fullAddress' column isn't uniquely identifying properties e.g. sometimes a property might have a Town/City of 'London' and a District of 'London' but on another transaction the District could be blank.
</p>


<p>
On top of that, my strategy of looking for subsequent prices to spot anomalies falls down when trying to explore properties which only have one sale.
</p>


<p>
So I have a couple of things to look into for now but once I've done those it'd be interesting to write an algorithm/program that could predict which transactions are likely to be anomalies. 
</p>


<p>
I can imagine how that might work if I had a labelled training set but I'm not sure if I could do it with an unsupervised algorithm so if you have any pointers let me know.
