title="Neo4j: The football transfers graph"

<p>Given we're still in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33531715">pre season</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33528451">transfer madness</a> as far as European football is concerned I thought it'd be interesting to put together a football transfers graph to see whether there are any interesting insights to be had.
</p>


<p>
It took me a while to find an appropriate source but I eventually came across <a href="http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/premier-league/sommertransfers/wettbewerb/GB1/saison_id/2015">transfermarkt.co.uk</a> which contains transfers going back at least as far as the start of the Premier League in 1992.
</p>


<p>
I wrote a quick Python script to create a CSV file of all the transfers. This is what the file looks like:
</p>



~~~bash

$ head -n 10 data/transfers.csv
player,from_team,from_team_id,to_team,to_team_id,fee,season
Martin Keown,Everton,29,Arsenal FC,11,"2,10 Mill. £",1992-1993
John Jensen,Bröndby IF,206,Arsenal FC,11,"1,12 Mill. £",1992-1993
Alan Miller,Birmingham,337,Arsenal FC,11,,1992-1993
Jim Will,Sheffield Utd.,350,Arsenal FC,11,,1992-1993
David Rocastle,Arsenal FC,11,Leeds,399,"1,68 Mill. £",1992-1993
Perry Groves,Arsenal FC,11,Southampton FC,180,595 Th. £,1992-1993
Ty Gooden,Arsenal FC,11,Wycombe Wand.,2805,?,1992-1993
Geraint Williams,Derby,22,Ipswich Town,677,525 Th. £,1992-1993
Jason Winters,Chelsea U21,9250,Ipswich Town,677,?,1992-1993
~~~

<p>
I'm going to create the following graph and then we'll write some queries which explore chains of transfers involving players and clubs.
</p>

</div>

<p>
I wrote a few import scripts using Neo4j's <a href="http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/query-load-csv.html">LOAD CSV</a> command, having set up the appropriate indexes first:
</p>



~~~cypher

create index on :Team(id);
create index on :Season(name);
create index on :Transfer(description);
create index on :Player(name);
~~~


~~~cypher

// teams
load csv with headers from "file:///Users/markneedham/projects/football-transfers/data/teams.csv" as row
merge (team:Team {id: toint(row.team_id)})
on create set team.name = row.team;

// seasons
load csv with headers from "file:///Users/markneedham/projects/football-transfers/data/transfers.csv" as row
merge (season:Season {name: row.season})
ON CREATE SET season.starts =  toint(split(season.name, "-")[0]);

// players
load csv with headers from "file:///Users/markneedham/projects/football-transfers/data/transfers.csv" as row
merge (player:Player {name: row.player});

// transfers
load csv with headers from "file:///Users/markneedham/projects/football-transfers/data/transfers.csv" as row
match (from:Team {id: toint(row.from_team_id)})
match (to:Team {id: toint(row.to_team_id)})
match (season:Season {name: row.season})
match (player:Player {name: row.player})

merge (transfer:Transfer {description: row.player + " from " + from.name + " to " + to.name})
merge (transfer)-[:FROM_TEAM]->(from)
merge (transfer)-[:TO_TEAM]->(to)
merge (transfer)-[:IN_SEASON]->(season)
merge (transfer)-[:PLAYER]->(player);

// connect transfers
match (season)<-[:IN_SEASON]-(transfer:Transfer)-[:PLAYER]->(player)
WITH player, season, transfer
ORDER BY player.name, season.starts
WITH player, COLLECT({s: season, t: transfer}) AS transfers
UNWIND range(0, length(transfers)-2) AS idx
WITH player, transfers[idx] AS t1, transfers[idx +1] AS t2
WITH player, t1.t AS t1, t2.t AS t2
MERGE (t1)-[:NEXT]->(t2);
~~~

<P>All the files and scripts are on <a href="https://gist.github.com/mneedham/2c0b28ebe2314cb5eab5">this gist</a> if you want to play around with the data. The only thing you'll need to change is the file path on each of the 'LOAD CSV' lines.
</p>


<p>
The 'connect transfers' query is a bit more complicated than the others - in that one we're first ordering the transfers in ascending order grouped by player and then <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2015/06/04/neo4j-cypher-step-by-step-to-creating-a-linked-list-of-adjacent-nodes-using-unwind/">creating a linked list</a> of a player's transfers.
</p>


<p>
Now that we've got the data loaded let's find out which player was transferred the most:
</p>



~~~cypher

match path = (:Transfer)-[:NEXT*0..]->(transfer:Transfer)
where NOT (transfer)-[:NEXT]->()
RETURN path 
ORDER BY LENGTH(path) DESC
LIMIT 1
~~~

<div>

</div>

<p>
Which other players have moved teams frequently?
</p>



~~~cypher

match path = (first:Transfer)-[:NEXT*0..]->(transfer:Transfer),
             (player)<-[:PLAYER]-(transfer)
where NOT ((transfer)-[:NEXT]->()) AND NOT ((first)<-[:NEXT]-())
RETURN player.name, LENGTH(path) AS numberOfTransfers 
ORDER BY numberOfTransfers DESC
LIMIT 10

<p>What are the most frequent combinations of clubs involved in transfers?</p>
