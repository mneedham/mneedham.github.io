<p>
I wanted to plot a chart showing the number of blog posts published by month and started with the following code which makes use of <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/index.html">zoo's</a> 'as.yearmon' function to add the appropriate column and grouping:
</p>



~~~r

> library(zoo)
> library(dplyr)
> df %>% sample_n(5)
                                                  title                date

> posts_by_date  = df %>% mutate(year_mon = as.Date(as.yearmon(date))) %>% count(year_mon)
> posts_by_date %>% head(5)

    year_mon  n
1 2006-08-01  1
2 2006-09-01  4
3 2008-02-01  4
4 2008-07-01  2
5 2008-08-01 38
~~~

<p>
I then plugged the new data frame into ggplot to get the chart:
</p>



~~~R

> ggplot(aes(x = year_mon, y = n), data = posts_by_date) + geom_line()
~~~

</div>

<p>
The problem with this chart is that it's showing there being 4 posts per month for all the dates between September 2006 and February 2008 even though I didn't write anything! It's doing the same thing between February 2008 and July 2008 too.
</p>


<p>
We can fix that by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14424565/how-to-fill-date-gaps-in-data-frame">filling in the gaps</a> with 0s.</p>


<p>First we'll create a vector containing every month in the data range contained by our data frame:
</p>



~~~r

> all_dates = seq(as.Date(as.yearmon(min(df$date))), as.Date(as.yearmon(max(df$date))), by="month")

> all_dates
  [1] "2006-08-01" "2006-09-01" "2006-10-01" "2006-11-01" "2006-12-01" "2007-01-01" "2007-02-01" "2007-03-01"

<p>
Now we need to create a data frame containing those dates and merge it with the original:
</p>



~~~r

posts_by_date_clean = merge(data.frame(date = all_dates),
                            posts_by_date,
                            by.x='date',
                            by.y='year_mon',
                            all.x=T,
                            all.y=T)

> posts_by_date_clean %>% head()
        date  n
1 2006-08-01  1
2 2006-09-01  4
3 2006-10-01 NA
4 2006-11-01 NA
5 2006-12-01 NA
6 2007-01-01 NA
~~~

<p>We've still got some 'NA' values in there which won't plot so well. Let's set those to 0 and then try and plot our chart again:</p>



~~~r

> posts_by_date_clean$n[is.na(posts_by_date_clean$n)] = 0
> ggplot(aes(x = date, y = n), data = posts_by_date_clean) + geom_line()
~~~

<div>

</div>

<p>
Much better!
