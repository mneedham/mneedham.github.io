<p>My former colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/annejsimmons">Anne Simmons</a> recently wrote an interesting post in which she describes <a href="http://annejsimmons.com/2013/07/16/the-fear-of-blogging-about-technical-topics/">some of the reasons that she finds herself not wanting to write about technical topics.</a>.</p>


<p>I wrote a post at the end of 2012 in which I explained some of the reasons why I think <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2013/01/05/a-new-years-idea-share-what-you-learn/">writing about what you learn is a good idea</a> but Anne brought up some things I hadn't thought of which I think are worth addressing.</p>


<p>She's already described her own mantras to overcome these but I thought it'd still be interesting to share my experience as well:</p>


<h4>What do I know that the internet doesn’t already?!</h4>

<p>I've found that then posts I write in which I aggregate a bunch of information that I found from different places tend to be my most read posts.</p>


<p>A lot of the people that I've worked with (including me) when encountered with a stack trace will paste it straight into google to try and solve their problem.</p>


<p>I've had the same experience as Anne in spending ages trying to solve a problem and thinking it would be cool to save someone else (usually future me) from having to rediscover the solution in the future.</p>


<h4>Will people judge me about what knowledge I do have?/What if  I’m wrong?!</h4>

<p>In 5 years of writing I've only had a couple of times when people commented in what I thought was an unnecessary manner but the majority of feedback has been very positive.</p>


<p>Frequently people actually teach me something that I didn't know rather than criticising what I do know so for me writing has been a net gain.</p>


<p>A strange side effect is that people think I know much more than I do based on writing about things I've been working on.</p>


<h4>In summary</h4>

<p>It can only be a good thing for the internet if more people write about the things that they're working on so I hope Anne keeps to her one post a month target!</p>


<p>I'll finish off with the <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">Eric Raymond</a> quote that I used on <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2013/01/05/a-new-years-idea-share-what-you-learn/">my previous post about sharing what you learn</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn’t be wasted on re-inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating new problems waiting out there.

To behave like a hacker, you have to believe that the thinking time of other hackers is precious — so much so that <strong>it’s almost a moral duty for you to share information, solve problems and then give the solutions away just so other hackers can solve new problems instead of having to perpetually re-address old ones</strong>.
