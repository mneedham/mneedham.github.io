<p>When I first started working at <a href="http://www.uswitch.com/">uSwitch</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/siddharthdawara">Sid</a> installed a couple of 'productivity applications' on my Mac which I've found pretty useful but from talking to others I realised they aren't known/being used by everyone.</p>


<h4>Alfred</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_(software)">Quick Silver</a> replacement which allows you to quickly open applications, find files, search Google and more. Even though we're not using half of its features it's still proved to be useful.</p>


<p>I quite like the calculator feature which we've been using for adhoc calculation like working out <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2013/04/10/awk-parsing-free-m-output-to-get-memory-usageconsumption/">how much free memory there was on a server</a> or the <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2013/04/28/ab-testing-reporting/">conversion rate on part of an A/B test</a>.</p>

</div>

<h4>Moom</h4>

<p>The other application is <a href="http://manytricks.com/moom/">Moom</a> which allows you to move/resize windows.</p>


<p>I didn't see the point when I first saw it but it's actually really useful when you're working on a big monitor and want to put say the terminal alongside the browser.</p>


<p>We have the following shortcuts set up:</p>

</div>

<p>That allows us to type 'Ctrl + Space' to make the window fill the left hand side of the screen, 'Alt + Space' to make it fill the right hand side of the screen and 'Alt + Ctrl + Space' to fill the whole screen.</p>


<p>You can also set up shortcuts to allow you to move a window between displays or to rearrange the windows based on certain events.</p>


<p>Highly recommended!</p>


<p>If anyone knows any other cool tools like this I'd love to hear about them.</p>
