<p>A reasonable amount of the information that I consume comes either via scanning <a href="https://twitter.com/">twitter</a> or from my <a href="http://getprismatic.com/news/home">prismatic</a> feed but I noticed that I'm quite biased to reading things in similar subject areas.</p>


<p>I tend to end up reading about data mining/science, functional programming and startups and while the articles are mostly interesting it does eventually start to feel like you're in an echo chamber.</li>

<p>I have a subscription to the <a href="http://www.acm.org/">ACM</a> mainly because I enjoy reading the 'Communications of the ACM' magazine which gets sent out every month and until recently I only read articles which I thought would be interesting.</p>


<p>This unfortunately meant that I was adding to the problem I mentioned earlier whereby everything I read is about similar topics.</p>


<p>I decided to try and change that by reading the magazine from cover to cover and although I haven't finished yet it's been an interesting experience and I've read about things that I wouldn't have thought to read about including:</p>


<ul>
<li>Do more computer science papers get rejected than those in other subjects?</li>
<li>How do we allow people to vote in areas where there's been a natural disaster?</li>
<li>Why are there currently so many post-docs in computer science?</li>
<li>How should we go about analysing performance problems?</li>
</ul>

<p>This seems to be a reasonably good way of diversifying what I read/learn because an editor has decided what I should read rather than me choosing or an algorithm choosing based on what I've previously read.</p>


<p>Having said that, I'd be intrigued to know what approaches/strategies others have for getting knowledge of a broader range of topics.</p>
