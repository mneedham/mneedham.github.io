<p>I was recently reading <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/10066147/Sir-Alex-Fergusons-unparalleled-experience-of-success-and-management-must-not-be-wasted-by-football.htm">an article written by Henry Winter</a> where he mentioned some of the ideas that Sir ALex Ferguson has been covering in some interviews he's been doing at Harvard and one bit stood out for me:
</p>


<blockquote>
In a series of interviews in Harvard, Ferguson debated dealing with “fragile” egos in the dressing room, the power of the two simple words “well done” in motivating individuals and <strong>the importance of criticising players’ mistakes immediately after the match and then moving on</strong>.
</blockquote>

<p>I've written previously about <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/category/feedback/">giving feedback</a> and I think we don't place enough emphasis on how useful it is to give any feedback close to the time of the event.</p>


<p>My former colleague <a href="http://twitter.com/ryangreenhall">Ryan Greenhall</a> was particularly good at noticing situations where timely feedback was required and I hadn't realised how much of an impact doing that had.</p>


<p>As we as the immediate benefit of the event being fresh in people's minds when they're talking about it we get an added benefit as well.</p>


<p>The more time that we leave between an event happening and reflecting on it, the more time there is for us to invent a story about what happened that helps to explain it.</p>


<p>In the story we create in our mind we'll often associate negative traits/motives to the other person and exaggerate the importance of what happened until it doesn't resemble what actually happened any more.</p>


<p>I tended to veer away from addressing things like this immediately because I thought it seemed like overreacting to believe that it was worth having a conversation but it now seems worthwhile.</p>


<p>In the worst case you just discover there was nothing to reflect on and in the best case you resolve any issues at the source.</p>
