<p>I wrote earlier in the year about <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2012/01/22/playing-around-with-pomodoros/">my use of pomodoros to track what I'm doing outside of work</a> and having done this for 6 months I noticed that I'm now procrastinating over picking something off the list to work on.</p>


<p><em>(I knowâ€¦I am awesome!)</em></p>


<p>I'm not sure whether this is because I don't have anything really appealing on the list of things to work on or whether having so many things listed (I have 8-10  items) is causing the paralysis.</p>


<p>Either way it's a bit frustrating to achieve nothing in an evening because of something so ridiculous.</p>


<p>To outwit myself I decided to press the 'Start' button on the timer one day without picking something to work on and hoped that this would snap me out of my paralysis.</p>


<p>It's a relatively simple tweak but somehow seeing the time count down has the required effect and I've usually picked what I'm going to do within 30 seconds or so.</p>


<p>So if you are as good at procrastinating as me maybe you can try this too!</p>
