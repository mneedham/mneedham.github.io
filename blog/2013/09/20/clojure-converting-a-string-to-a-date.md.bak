title="Clojure: Converting a string to a date"
tag=['clojure']
category=['Clojure']
+++

<p>I wanted to do some date manipulation in Clojure recently and figured that since <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/clj-time">clj-time</a> is a wrapper around <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/">Joda Time</a> it'd probably do the trick.</p>


<p>The first thing we need to do is add the dependency to our project file and then run <cite>lein reps</cite> to pull down the appropriate JARs. The project file should look something like this:</p>


<em>project.clj</em>

~~~lisp

(defproject ranking-algorithms "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.4.0"]
                 [clj-time "0.6.0"]])
~~~

<p>Now let's load the clj-time.format namespace into the REPL since we know we'll be parsing dates:</p>



~~~lisp

> (require '(clj-time [format :as f]))
~~~

<p>The string that I want to convert into a date looks like this:</p>



~~~lisp

(def string-date "18 September 2012")
~~~

<p>The first thing we should do is check whether there is an existing formatter that we can use by evaluating the following function:</p>



~~~lisp

> (f/show-formatters)
...
:hour-minute                            06:45
:hour-minute-second                     06:45:22
:hour-minute-second-fraction            06:45:22.473
:hour-minute-second-ms                  06:45:22.473
:mysql                                  2013-09-20 06:45:22
:ordinal-date                           2013-263
:ordinal-date-time                      2013-263T06:45:22.473Z
:ordinal-date-time-no-ms                2013-263T06:45:22Z
:rfc822                                 Fri, 20 Sep 2013 06:45:22 +0000
...

<p>There are a lot of different built in formatters but unfortunately I couldn't find one that exactly matched our date format so we'll have to write our own one.</p>


<p>For that we'll need to refresh our knowledge of <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">Java date formatting</a>:</p>


<div align="center">
<img src="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-20_07-48-52.png" alt="2013 09 20 07 48 52" title="2013-09-20_07-48-52.png" border="0" width="600" height="398" />
</div>

<p>We end up with the following formatter:</p>



~~~lisp

> (f/parse (f/formatter "dd MMM YYYY") string-date)
#<DateTime 2012-09-18T00:00:00.000Z>
~~~

<p>It took me much longer than it should have to remember that 'MMM' is the pattern to match a short form of a month but it's just the same as what we'd have to do in Java but with some neat wrapper functions.</p>
