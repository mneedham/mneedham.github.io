<p>A few months ago I wrote about <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2013/07/22/lessons-from-supporting-production-code/">my experiences supporting production code</a> while working at <a href="http://www.uswitch.com/">uSwitch</a>.

<p>Since then I've been working on support for Neo4j customers and I've realised that there are a couple of other things to keep in mind while debugging production problems that I missed from the initial list.</p>


<h3>Keep a clear head / Hold back your assumptions</h3>

<p>The first is that it's very helpful to completely <strong>clear your head of any assumptions</strong> when looking at a problem.</p>


<p>I've got into the habit of pattern matching different error messages that I come across with root causes and while that's sometimes useful, often there are subtle differences which mean the root cause is different.</p>


<p>Although I still sometimes fall into the assumptions trap I've found that it helps to ask exactly what someone is trying to do rather than immediately trying to solve the problem.</p>


<h3>Look for the simple things</h3>

<p>Along with the assumptions another mistake I make is to imagine the most complicated version of events that could lead to a problem manifesting.</p>


<p>Sometimes this is the case but more frequently a configuration setting may have been misunderstood or a query poorly designed and the problem can be resolved more easily.</p>


<p>To stop myself making this mistake I have a rough flow chart in my head working down from simpler causes to more complicated ones for different problem areas.</p>


<p>As I said, I still do make assumptions and look for complicated reasons for problems but by keeping these two things in mind I think/hope I'm doing it less often than I used to!</p>
