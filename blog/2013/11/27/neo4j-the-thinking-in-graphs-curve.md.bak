title="Neo4j: The 'thinking in graphs' curve"
tag=['neo4j']

<p>In a couple of Neo4j talks I've done recently I've been asked how long it takes to get used to modelling data in graphs and whether I felt it's simpler than alternative approaches.</p>
 

<p>My experience of 'thinking in graphs'â„¢ closely mirrors what I believe is a fairly common curve when learning technologies which change the way you think:</p>

<p>There is an initial stage where <strong>it seems really hard because it's different to what we're used to</strong> and at this stage we might want to go back to what we're used to.</p>


<p>If we persevere, however, we will get over that hump and after that <strong>it will be difficult to imagine another way of modelling data</strong> - at least in domains where the connections between different bits of data are important.</p>


<p>Once we're over the hump data modelling should seem like fun and we'll start looking to see whether we can use graphs to solve other problems we've got.</p>


<p>I wasn't sure whether modelling in graphs is simpler than alternative approaches so as a thought experiment I decided to see what part of my football graph would look like if it was modelled in a relational database.</p>


<p>This is the graph model:</p>

</div>

<p>If we went for a normalised relational design it might look like this:</p>

</div>

<p>I think this is at least equal in complexity to the graph model and it wouldn't be much fun writing queries against it as the joins pile up!</p>


<p>Of course this comparison is on a data set which is very graphy in nature and therefore well suited for Neo4j. There are certainly other domains where a relational approach would be much more effective.</p>
