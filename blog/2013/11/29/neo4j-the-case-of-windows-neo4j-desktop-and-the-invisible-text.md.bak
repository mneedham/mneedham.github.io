title="Neo4j: The case of neo4j-shell and the invisible text ft. Windows and the neo4j-desktop "

<p>I've been playing around with Neo4j on a Windows VM recently and I wanted to launch <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/shell.html">neo4j-shell</a> to run a few queries.</p>


<p>The neo4j-shell script isn't shipped with <a href="http://blog.neo4j.org/2013/09/installer-check-desktop-launcher-check.html">Neo4j desktop</a> which I used to install Neo4j on my VM but we can still launch it from the Windows Command Prompt with the following command:</p


~~~bash

C:\Users\Mark> cd "C:\Program Files\Neo4j Community"
C:\Program Files\Neo4j Community>jre\bin\java -cp bin\neo4j-desktop-2.0.0-RC1.jar org.neo4j.shell.StartClient

Welcome to the Neo4j Shell! Enter 'help' for a list of commands
NOTE: Remote Neo4j graph database service 'shell' at port 1337
Want bash-like features? throw in jLine (http://jline.sourceforge.net) on the classpath
~~~

<p>Unfortunately if we start typing in a query we don't get any feedback as to what we're typed, although if we type something syntactically valid and suffix it with a semi colon and press enter it will be evaluated!</p>


<p>e.g. this is the output from entering the following query</p>



~~~cypher

START n = node(*) RETURN COUNT(n);

</div>

<p>The reason for the problem is to do with the '.shell_history' file that the shell tries to write to the directory it's launched from. In this case we don't have permission to write anything to 'C:\Program Files\Neo4j Community' and so we get no feedback.</p>


<p>To workaround this problem we need to start the command prompt as an administrator which we can do from the apps menu by right clicking the 'Command Prompt' icon:</p>

</div>

<p>Next we click 'Start as Administrator' and click through the next screen:</p>

</div>

<p>Now if we launch neo4j-shell and type in our query we get the expected feedback:</p>
