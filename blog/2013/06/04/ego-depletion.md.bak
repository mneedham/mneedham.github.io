<p>On the recommendation of <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_jones">Mike Jones</a> I've been reading through Daniel Kahneman's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0141033576/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1370274373&sr=8-1&keywords=thinking+fast+and+slow">Thinking Fast and Slow</a> in which the first part of the book covers our two styles of thinking:</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>System 1</strong> - operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.</li>
<li><strong>System 2</strong> - allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.</li>
</ul>

<p>He then uses a series of stories to explain this in more detail but I found an experiment run by Roy Baumeister the most interesting:</p>


<blockquote>
A series of surprising experiments [...] has shown conclusively that all variants of voluntary effort - cognitive, emotional, or physical - draw at least partly on a shared pool of mental energy. Their experiments involve successive rather than simultaneous tasks.

Baumeister's group has repeatedly found that an effort of will or self control is tiring; if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around.

The phenomenon has been named <strong>ego depletion</strong>.
</blockquote>

<p>This particularly resonates with me as I've frequently seen people (including myself) let a series of events involving another person to go by before finally snapping over something seemingly innocuous.</p>


<p>Quite frequently the other person had no idea that the way they were behaving was irritating so the reaction comes as a surprise to them!</p>


<p>We can get around this problem to some extent by <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2013/05/23/feedback-reacting-immediately/">providing timely feedback</a> but in order for that to happen I think we need to admit to ourselves when we are frustrated rather than pretending that it doesn't bother us.</p>


<p>It will probably feel silly to address these innocuous events so early on when we don't think they're bothering us that much but I think it's better than the explosive alternative!</p>
