      <description>I recently had a typo in a Pinot ingestion transformation function and wanted to have Pinot re-process the Kafka stream without having to restart all the things. In this blog post we&amp;#8217;ll learn how to do that.

      <title>Kafka: Writing data to a topic from the command line</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been doing more Apache Pinot documentation - this time covering the JSON functions - and I needed to quickly write some data into Kafka to test things out. I&amp;#8217;d normally do that using the Python Kafka client, but this time I wanted to do it using only command line tools. So that&amp;#8217;s what we&amp;#8217;ll be doing in this blog post and it&amp;#8217;s more for future me than anyone else!</description>

      <title>Apache Pinot: Sorted indexes on real-time tables</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently been learning all about Apache Pinot&amp;#8217;s sorted forward indexes, and in my first blog post I explained how they work for offline tables. In this blog post we&amp;#8217;ll learn how sorted indexes work with real-time tables.

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently been learning all about Apache Pinot&amp;#8217;s sorted forward indexes. I was initially going to explain how they work for offline and real-time tables, but the post got a bit long, so instead we&amp;#8217;ll have two blog posts. In this one we&amp;#8217;ll learn how sorted indexes are applied for offline tables.

      <title>Strava: Export and interpolate lat/long points for an activity</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working with Strava data again recently and wanted to extract all the lat/long coordinates recorded for my runs. Having done this, I realised that my running watch hadn&amp;#8217;t recorded as many points as I expected, so I needed to interpolate the missing points. In this blog post we&amp;#8217;ll learn how to do that.
  Figure 1. Strava: Export and interpolate lat/long points for an activity  Setup Let&amp;#8217;s first install a few libraries that we&amp;#8217;ll be using:</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with geometry objects in WKT format while documenting Apache Pinot&amp;#8217;s Geospatial functions. I then wanted to figure out how to generate a WKT string from a list of lat long coordinates, which we&amp;#8217;ll learn how to do in this blog post.
  Figure 1. Python: Generate WKT from Lat Long Coordinates  We&amp;#8217;re going to do all this using Python&amp;#8217;s Shapely library, so let&amp;#8217;s first install that library:</description>

      <title>Apache Pinot: Checking which indexes are defined</title>

      <description>One of the most common questions in the Apache Pinot community Slack is how to work out which indexes are defined on columns in Pinot segments. This blog post will attempt to answer that question.
  Figure 1. Apache Pinot: Checking which indexes are defined  Setup First, we&amp;#8217;re going to spin up a local instance of Pinot using the following Docker compose config:
 docker-compose.yml version: &#39;3.7&#39; services: zookeeper: image: zookeeper:3.</description>
