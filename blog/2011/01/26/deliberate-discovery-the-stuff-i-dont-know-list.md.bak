Towards the end of Dan North's post on <a href="http://dannorth.net/2010/08/30/introducing-deliberate-discovery/">Deliberate Discovery</a> he makes the following suggestion:

<blockquote>
There is much more to say about deliberate discovery. Think about applying the principle to learning a new language, or picking up a new technology, or a new domain. What could you do to identify and reduce your ignorance most rapidly? 
</blockquote>

This reminded me a lot of what I used to do when I came across things that I didn't know how to do a few years ago.

I would write down the thing that I didn't know and then make sure that I looked up the things on my list at the end of the day and then discuss what I'd read/learnt with a colleague the next day.

More recently I've fallen into what I'd call a complacent pattern where if I find something that I don't know 100% how to do I don't go out of my way to check that I actually know how to do it now.

I have more confidence that I'll be able to work out how to do something if the need arises but I don't gain that knowledge right away.

Effectively <strong>I've continued identifying my ignorance but haven't taken the steps to reduce it</strong>.

Now that I've realised I'm doing this I've started writing down things that I don't know on a "Stuff I don't know list" and I'm back to spending some time each evening to run through the list and at least gain some knowledge on each item.

One problem I used to find when I did this before was that I'd start reading about one thing and then I'd notice something else that I didn't know, go off and read about that and so on until I'd forgotten what I was originally trying to learn.

To try and combat that I've been time-boxing myself with a <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">pomodoro</a> while I'm working through the list and then adding any new concepts I come across to the end of the list.

Another mistake I've made/sometimes do make is reading very passively i.e. I read the information but don't really understand it.

To get around that problem I've been talking to colleagues about what I've been reading, as suggested by Andy Hunt in <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2008/10/06/pragmatic-learning-and-thinking-book-review/">Pragmatic Thinking and Learning</a>.

In addition I tend to remember things better if I actually get to use them in practice rather than just learning the theory.

Since the majority of the reading I've been doing lately has been around networking I've been using <a href="http://openmaniak.com/tcpdump.php">tcpdump</a> and <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">wireshark</a> so I can see the theory in action.

Unfortunately those are another two things I don't know so I'm learning about them as I go.
