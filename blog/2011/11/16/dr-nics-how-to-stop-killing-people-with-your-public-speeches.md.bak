I recently came across a really cool blog post by Dr Nic titled '<a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/2011/11/11/how-to-stop-killing-people-with-your-public-speeches/">How to stop killing people with your public speeches</a>' where he talks about the importance of practicing our presentations so that they actually make an impact on our audience.

Towards the end of the post he suggests joining <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/">Toastmasters</a> as a useful first step for getting used to speaking to a group of people and as an added bonus you get feedback after each speech you give.

When I finished university in 2005 the one thing that I feared above all else was speaking in front of a group of people.

At the time I was an avid reader of <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/07/failing-with-toastmasters/">Steve Pavlina's blog</a> and in one of his posts he recommended Toastmasters as a way of overcoming the fear.

I attended Toastmasters sessions every fortnight for about 18 months in 2006/2007, getting through 7 of the 10 speeches, before I decided to go off and learn open mic standup comedy, but that's another story.

It's a really safe environment to practice in because it doesn't matter if you make mistakes and the other people are there to help you improve.

Apart from getting comfortable speaking to a group, the main thing I learnt from Toastmasters is that it's much more fun doing a speech if you can see that the audience is engaged.

In order for that to happen that meant that <strong>I needed to write a speech which I found fun to deliver</strong>, an approach which can be applied to any presentation that we give.

In my case this means that there has to be some sort of humour in the talk but I imagine this may be different for other people.

A couple of years ago while I was preparing for a presentation I was going to give to the <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2009/06/30/f-what-ive-learnt-so-far/">Sydney ALT .NET user group</a>, <a href="http://erik.doernenburg.com/">Erik Doernenburg</a> suggested to me that the talk would be more interesting if I <strong>put a personal spin on it and told it as a story</strong>.

I found that it was actually much more interesting to prepare the talk once I took this approach and it was easier to present since I was framing the talk as being about my experience rather than (implicitly) claiming to be an expert of some sort.

When I started at Toastmasters I used to write out my whole talk word for word but now I tend to have a rough outline in my head which leaves some room to ad lib depending on how it's going.

I now feel really comfortable in front of a group of people so I'd certainly second Dr Nic in recommending Toastmasters as an excellent way of overcoming any fears of public speaking and honing the skill.
