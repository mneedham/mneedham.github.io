While I've been <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/category/android-2/">learning how to write an android application</a> there's been plenty of opportunities for me to go off <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/?s=shaving+yak">shaving yaks</a>, it's pretty much Yakville Central.

Typically I'd end up spending hours trying to work out some obscure thing which I didn't really need to know so I wanted to try and avoid that this time.

I started keeping a track of the 'yak stack' which I was currently following and mentally noting exactly where I was up to.

An example of a yak stack I kept while trying to authorise a user of the app with Twitter using OAuth is shown in the photo on the right hand side.

It ended up looking like this:

<ul>
  <li>Get the home timeline working
    <ul>
      <li>OAuth blowing up
      <ul>
        <li>Not actually capturing redirect back to app
        <ul>
          <li>Launch mode in Android manifest
          </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Once I realise I'm heading down the stack I've been giving myself one <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">pomodoro</a> to  try and dig myself one level up.

If I still haven't managed to solve the problem I might keep going for one more pomodoro or just find another way around the problem.

I'm sure I'll come across problems where I need to spend more than an hour trying to solve it but for now it's working ok as a rule of thumb.

It's definitely fun chasing yaks but I get to the end of the day and haven't really achieved anything which isn't fun.
