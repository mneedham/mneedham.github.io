title="IntelliJ: Adding resources with unusual extensions onto the classpath"
tag=['intellij']
category=['Software Development']
+++

We're making use of <a href="http://www.marklogic.com/">MarkLogic</a> and therefore <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xquery/default.asp">xquery</a> on the project I'm currently working on and recently wanted to add our xquery setup files onto the classpath so they could be used in a test.

We added them into 'src/main/resources' and set that as a source path in IntelliJ assuming that was all we needed to do.

Despite doing that our test kept failing because it couldn't locate the files on the classpath.

<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=8818047&authType=name&authToken=w9yv&locale=en_US&pvs=pp&trk=ppro_viewmore">Charles</a> eventually came across the compiler resource patterns settings which are accessible from the Preferences > Compiler menu:

We had to add "*.xqy" to the end of the list of patterns to get our files picked up.

We came across another file extension that we needed to be on the classpath about 10 minutes later and obviously solved it much quicker that time!
