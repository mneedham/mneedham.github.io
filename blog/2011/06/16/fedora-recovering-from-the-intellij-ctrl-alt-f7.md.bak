title="Fedora: Recovering from the IntelliJ 'Ctrl-Alt-F7'"
tag=['software-development']
category=['Software Development']
+++

We're using Fedora on our local developer work stations and some of the default key bindings of the operating system seem to conflict with ones provided by IntelliJ IDEA.

One particular amusing one is 'Ctrl-Alt-F7' which you use in IntelliJ to see the usages of a piece of code.

In Fedora that seems to switch into a different X Server session and you just see a blank screen with seemingly no way out!

Pressing 'Ctrl-Alt-F1' helps us get back to our original session again.
