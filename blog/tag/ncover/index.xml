      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending quite a bit of time setting up NCoverand then integrating it into Team City.
I&amp;rsquo;ve read some posts which cover parts of this process but nothing which covers the end to end process so hopefully my experience can help to fill that void.
&amp;lt;loadtasks assembly=&amp;#34;..\lib\NCoverExplorer.Extras\NCoverExplorer.NAntTasks.dll&amp;#34;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;exec program=&amp;#34;regsvr32&amp;#34; workingdir=&amp;#34;..\lib\NCover-1.5.8&amp;#34; commandline=&amp;#34;/s coverlib.dll&amp;#34;/&amp;gt; I put this right at the top of the build but I expect it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter where it goes as long as it&amp;rsquo;s called at some stage before NCover and NCover Explorer are called.</description>

      <title>Encapsulation in build scripts using nant</title>

      <description>When writing build scripts it&amp;rsquo;s very easy for it to descend into complete Xml hell when you&amp;rsquo;re using a tool like nant.
I wondered previouslywhether it was possible to TDD build files and while this is difficult given the dependency model most build tools follow. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we can&amp;rsquo;t apply other good design principles from the coding world however.
Encapsulationis one of the key principles of OOP and it can be applied in build files too.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to integrate NCoverinto our build and probably making life harder for myself than it needs to be.
The title refers to the error message that I was getting when trying to run the ncover nant taskon version 1.0.1 of NCover earlier today.
[ncover] Starting &amp;#39;C:\Program Files\NCover\ncover-console.exe (//r &amp;#34;\long\path\to\tmp392.tmp.ncoversettings&amp;#34; )&amp;#39; in &amp;#39;C:\my-project\trunk\src&amp;#39; [ncover] Unhandled Exception: System.ArgumentException: Requested value &amp;#39;/r&amp;#39; was not found. [ncover] at System.Enum.Parse(Type enumType, String value, Boolean ignoreCase) [ncover] at NCover.</description>
