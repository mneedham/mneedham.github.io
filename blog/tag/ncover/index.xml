      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been spending quite a bit of time setting up NCover and then integrating it into Team City.
 I&amp;#8217;ve read some posts which cover parts of this process but nothing which covers the end to end process so hopefully my experience can help to fill that void.
 Step 1 Download NCover 1.5.8, NCover Explorer 1.4.0.7, NCover Explorer Extras 1.4.0.5 from Kiwidude&amp;#8217;s website and the NCover website .
   Step 2 Put the following into your Nant build file:</description>

      <description>When writing build scripts it&amp;#8217;s very easy for it to descend into complete Xml hell when you&amp;#8217;re using a tool like nant.
 I wondered previously whether it was possible to TDD build files and while this is difficult given the dependency model most build tools follow. That doesn&amp;#8217;t mean we can&amp;#8217;t apply other good design principles from the coding world however.
 Encapsulation is one of the key principles of OOP and it can be applied in build files too.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to integrate NCover into our build and probably making life harder for myself than it needs to be.
 The title refers to the error message that I was getting when trying to run the ncover nant task on version 1.0.1 of NCover earlier today.
 [ncover] Starting &#39;C:\Program Files\NCover\ncover-console.exe (//r &#34;\long\path\to\tmp392.tmp.ncoversettings&#34; )&#39; in &#39;C:\my-project\trunk\src&#39; [ncover] Unhandled Exception: System.ArgumentException: Requested value &#39;/r&#39; was not found. [ncover] at System.</description>
