      <description>In our latest book club we discussed J.B. Rainsberger&amp;rsquo;s presentation from Agile 2009 titled &amp;lsquo;Integration tests are a scam&amp;rsquo;.
These are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the video:
I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued as to how repositories and factories would fit into this picture as I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether they count as services, entities or value types. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on code bases where we&amp;rsquo;ve created interfaces for them but I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that means they would be services or that we did something wrong.</description>
