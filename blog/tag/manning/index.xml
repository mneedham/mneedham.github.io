      <description>The Book Brownfield Application Development in .NET by Kyle Baley and Donald Belcham
The Review I asked to be sent this book to review by Manning as I was quite intrigued to see how well it would complement Michael Feather&amp;rsquo;s Working Effectively with Legacy Code, the other book I&amp;rsquo;m aware of which covers approaches to dealing with non green field applications.
What did I learn?  The authors provide a brief description of the two different approaches to unit testing - state based and behaviour based - I&#39;m currently in favour of the latter approach and Martin Fowler has a well known article which covers pretty much anything you&#39;d want to know about this topic area.</description>
