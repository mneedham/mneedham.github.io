      <description>The Book Brownfield Application Development in .NET by Kyle Baley and Donald Belcham
The Review I asked to be sent this book to review by Manning as I was quite intrigued to see how well it would complement Michael Feather’s Working Effectively with Legacy Code, the other book I’m aware of which covers approaches to dealing with non green field applications.
What did I learn? The authors provide a brief description of the two different approaches to unit testing - state based and behaviour based - I’m currently in favour of the latter approach and Martin Fowler has a well known article which covers pretty much anything you’d want to know about this topic area.</description>
