      <description>Brownfield Application Development in .NETby Kyle Baley and Donald Belcham
I asked to be sent this book to review by Manning as I was quite intrigued to see how well it would complement Michael Feather&amp;rsquo;s Working Effectively with Legacy Code, the other book I&amp;rsquo;m aware of which covers approaches to dealing with non green field applications.
I often end up over complicating code in an attempt to create &amp;lsquo;abstractions&amp;rsquo; but by this definition I&amp;rsquo;m not really abstracting since I&amp;rsquo;m not simplifying but complicating!</description>
