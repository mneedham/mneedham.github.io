      <description>As I mentioned in a blog post a couple of weeks ago, I&#39;ve been playing around with the Kaggle House Prices competition and the most recent thing I tried was training a random forest regressor.  Unfortunately, although it gave me better results locally it got a worse score on the unseen data, which I figured meant I&#39;d overfitted the model.  I wasn&#39;t really sure how to work out if that theory was true or not, but by chance I was reading Chris Albon&#39;s blog and found a post where he explains how to inspect the importance of every feature in a random forest.</description>
