      <description>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique used with Large Language Models (LLM) where you augment the prompt with data retrieved from a data store so that the LLM can generate a better answer to the question that is being asked. In this blog post, we’re going to learn the basics of RAG by creating a Question and Answer system on top of the 2023 Wimbledon Championships Wikipedia page.</description>

      <description>Following on from a blog post that I wrote yesterday about doing similarity search with ChromaDB, I noticed an odd error message being printed as the script was exiting. In this blog post, we’ll explore what was going on.
To recap, I have the following code to find chunks of YouTube transcripts that are most similar to an input query:
test_chroma.py from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma hf_embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=&amp;#39;sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2&amp;#39;) store = Chroma(collection_name=&amp;#34;transcript&amp;#34;, persist_directory=&amp;#34;db&amp;#34;, embedding_function=hf_embeddings) result = store.</description>

      <description>Somewhat belatedly, I’ve been playing around with LangChain and HuggingFace to spike a tool that lets me ask question about Tim Berglund’s Real-Time Analytics podcast.
I’m using the Chroma database to store vectors of chunks of the transcript so that I can find appropriate sections to feed to the Large Language Model to help with answering my questions. I ran into an initially perplexing error while building this out, which we’re going to explore in this blog post.</description>
