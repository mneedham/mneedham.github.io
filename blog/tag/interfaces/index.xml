      <description>Iâ€™ve been writing some code to map between CouchDB documents and F# objects and something which I re-learned while doing this is the way that interfaces work in F#.
In F# when you have a class which implements an interface that class makes use of explicit interface implementation.
This means that in order to access any members of the interface that the class implements you need to specifically refer to the interface by upcasting the value using the &amp;#39;:&amp;gt;&amp;#39; operator.</description>
