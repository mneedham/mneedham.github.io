      <description>The way we have setup the build on our continuous integration server, Team City is configured to create a new tag every time the functional tests past successful on that machine.
We then have a QA and Showcase build that we can run to deploy all the artifacts necessary to launch the application on that machine.
Originally I had just written the batch script to take in the tag of the build which the user could find by looking through repo-browser for the last tag created.</description>

      <description>I mentioned in a couple of earlier posts that I’ve been doing quite a bit of work with batch files and the windows command line, and today I wanted to do an If Else statement in one of my scripts.
I thought it would be relatively simple, but after various searches and having read articles that suggested that there wasn’t an ELSE construct in batch land I finally found a forum post which explained how to do it.</description>

      <title>Getting the current working directory from DOS or Batch file</title>

      <description>In the world of batch files I’ve been trying for ages to work out how to get the current/present working directory to make the batch script I’m working on a bit more flexible.
In Unix it’s easy, just call &amp;#39;pwd&amp;#39; and you have it. I wasn’t expecting something that simple in Windows but it is! A call to &amp;#39;cd&amp;#39; is all that’s needed. If you need to set it in a batch script the following line does the trick:~ &amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; set WORKING_DIRECTORY=%cd%~ &amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/tbody&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt; I was surprised that something so simple (I do now feel like an idiot) wasn’t easier to find on Google.</description>

      <title>Spaces in batch scripts</title>

      <description>Since reading The Pragmatic Programmer I’ve become a bit of an automation junkie and writing batch scripts falls right under that category.
Unfortunately, nearly every single time I write one I forget that Windows really hates it when you have spaces in variable assignments, and I forget how to print out a usage message if the right number of parameters are not passed in.
So as much for me as for everyone else, this is how you do it:12345678910111213141516~ &amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; @ECHO offIF [%1]==[] GOTO usageIF [%2]==[] GOTO usageset VAR1=%1set VAR2=%2rem important client stuffgoto end:usageecho Usage: script.</description>
