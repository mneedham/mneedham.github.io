      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with some node.js code to get each of the commits from our git repository but noticed that it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be returning me all the results.
I had the following code:
var exec = require(&amp;#39;child_process&amp;#39;).exec; var gitRepository = &amp;#39;/some/local/path&amp;#39;; exec(&amp;#39;cd &amp;#39; + gitRepository + &amp;#39; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git log --pretty=format:&amp;#34;%H | %ad | %s%d&amp;#34; --date=raw &amp;#39;, function(error, stdout, stderror) { var commits = stdout.split(&amp;#34;\n&amp;#34;); // do some stuff with commits }); We have around 2000 commits in the repository but I was only getting back 1600 of them when I checked the lengthof commits.</description>

      <title>Learning node.js: Step</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with node.js to generate some graphs from our git repository which effectively meant chaining together a bunch of shell commands to give me the repository data in the format I wanted.
I was able to do this by making use of child_processwhich comes with the core library.
The first version looked like this:
var exec = require(&amp;#39;child_process&amp;#39;).exec, _ = require(&amp;#34;underscore&amp;#34;); ... function parseCommitsFromRepository(fn) { var gitRepository = &amp;#34;/tmp/core&amp;#34;; var gitPlayArea = &amp;#34;/tmp/&amp;#34; + new Date().</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with node.js again and one thing that I wanted to do was take a CSV file generated by the Go APIand extract the build times so that we could display it on a graph.
Since I don&amp;rsquo;t have a Go instance on my machine I created a URL in my node application which would mimic the API and return a CSV file.
I&amp;rsquo;m using the express web frameworkto take care of some of the plumbing:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been continuing to play around with node.jsand I thought it would be interesting to write a little application to poll Twitter every minute and save any new Tweets into a CouchDBdatabase.
I first played around with CouchDB in May last year and initially spent a lot of time trying to work out how to install it before coming across CouchDBXwhich gives you one click installation for Mac OS X.</description>
