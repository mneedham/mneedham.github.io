      <description>Listening to Dan North speaking last week I was reminded of one of my favourite NLP[*] techniques for making improvements on projects.
The technique is the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.O.T.E.[TOTE] (Test, Operate, Test, Exit) and it is a technique designed to help us get from where we are now to where we want to be via short feedback loops.
On my previous project we had a situation where we needed to build and deploy our application in order to show it to the client in a show case.</description>
