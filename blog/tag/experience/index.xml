      <description>I recently came across this post which speaks about the desire of recruiters to put candidates into technology specific boxes when it comes to describing their experience.
I guess this desire is backed by humans&amp;rsquo; need to see the patterns and similarities in data and having someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit into a generalised box makes it more difficult.
I have worked on projects in Java, C# and a bit of Ruby so I do agree with most of the points with regards to language specialisation and as Jay Fields points out it is actually beneficial to diversify your experience to improve yourself.</description>
