      <description>I just came across quite an insightful post by Jak Charlton titled &#39;http://devlicio.us/blogs/casey/archive/2009/09/25/ship-it-or-ship-out.aspx[Ship it or Ship out]&#39; in which he talks about the importance of shipping the software we work on, referring to Joel&amp;#8217;s recent post &#39;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html[The Duct Tape Programmer]&#39;.
 Unit testing When I first read Joel&amp;#8217;s post I didn&amp;#8217;t really like it because it seems to downplay the role of unit testing when coding, something which I believe is quite important from my experience of software development so far.</description>
