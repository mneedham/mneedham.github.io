      <description>I just came across quite an insightful post by Jak Charlton titled &amp;#39;Ship it or Ship out&amp;#39; in which he talks about the importance of shipping the software we work on, referring to Joel’s recent post &amp;#39;The Duct Tape Programmer&amp;#39;.
Unit testing When I first read Joel’s post I didn’t really like it because it seems to downplay the role of unit testing when coding, something which I believe is quite important from my experience of software development so far.</description>
