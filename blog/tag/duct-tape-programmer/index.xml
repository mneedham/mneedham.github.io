      <description>I just came across quite an insightful post by Jak Charlton titled &amp;lsquo;Ship it or Ship out&amp;rsquo; in which he talks about the importance of shipping the software we work on, referring to Joel&amp;rsquo;s recent post &amp;lsquo;The Duct Tape Programmer&amp;rsquo;.
Unit testing When I first read Joel&amp;rsquo;s post I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like it because it seems to downplay the role of unit testing when coding, something which I believe is quite important from my experience of software development so far.</description>
