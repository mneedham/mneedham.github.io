      <description>I did a presentation of some of the stuff that I&amp;#8217;ve learnt from playing around with F# over the last six months or so at the most recent Alt.NET Sydney meeting.
 I&amp;#8217;ve included the slides below but there was also some interesting discussion as well.
   One of the questions asked was around how you would deal with code on a real project with regards to structuring it and ensuring that it was maintainable.</description>

      <description>James Crisp and Richard Banks arranged the first Alt.NET Sydney User Group meeting held on Tuesday night at the ThoughtWorks office.
 The first thing to say is thanks to James and Richard for getting this setup so quickly - it was less than a month ago that Richard suggested the idea of creating a group on the Alt.NET mailing list.
 Richard and James have already written summaries of what went on but I thought I&amp;#8217;d give some of my thoughts as well.</description>
