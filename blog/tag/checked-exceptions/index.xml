      <description>One of the features that I dislike in Java compared to C# is checked exceptions.
For me an exception is about a situation which is exceptional, and if we know that there is a possibility of it happening and even have that possibility defined in our code then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem all that exceptional to me.
Having said that they do at least provide information which you can&amp;rsquo;t help but notice about what can go wrong when you make a call to a particular method.</description>
