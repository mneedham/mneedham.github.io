      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a presentation for the ThoughtWorks Europe away day over the last few days and I created some screen casts using Camtasia which I wanted to include.
It&amp;rsquo;s reasonably easy to insert movies into Powerpoint but I was finding that when I saved the file and then reloaded it the movies had been converted into images which wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I wanted at all!
Eventually I came across a blog post which explained that I&amp;rsquo;d been saving the file as the wrong format.</description>
