      <description>Towards the end of Dan North&amp;rsquo;s post on Deliberate Discoveryhe makes the following suggestion:
This reminded me a lot of what I used to do when I came across things that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to do a few years ago.
I would write down the thing that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know and then make sure that I looked up the things on my list at the end of the day and then discuss what I&amp;rsquo;d read/learnt with a colleague the next day.</description>
