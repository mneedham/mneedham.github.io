      <description>I had the chance to attend the XP2010 conference in Trondheim, Norway for a couple of days last week as I was presenting a lightening talk based on a blog post I wrote last year titled &#39;http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2009/08/13/challenging-projects-and-the-five-stages-of-grief/[Tough projects and the Kubler Ross Grief Cycle]&#39;.
 It was interesting to see the way another conference was organised as the only other conference I&amp;#8217;ve attended was QCon which is a much more technical conference.</description>

      <description>I attended an open space hosted by Emily Bache at the XP2010 conference in Trondheim, Norway with several other people who have been organising coding dojos around the world.
 It was really interesting to hear about some of the different approaches that people have taken and how a lot of the issues we had with the one we used to run in Sydney were the same as what others had experienced.</description>
