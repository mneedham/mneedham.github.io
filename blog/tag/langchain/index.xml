      <description>Following on from a blog post that I wrote yesterday about doing similarity search with ChromaDB, I noticed an odd error message being printed as the script was exiting. In this blog post, we’ll explore what was going on.
To recap, I have the following code to find chunks of YouTube transcripts that are most similar to an input query:
test_chroma.py from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma hf_embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=&amp;#39;sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2&amp;#39;) store = Chroma(collection_name=&amp;#34;transcript&amp;#34;, persist_directory=&amp;#34;db&amp;#34;, embedding_function=hf_embeddings) result = store.</description>

      <description>I’m starting to realise that things move insanely fast in the world of LLMs (Large Language Models) and you will run into issues because you aren’t using the latest version of libraries. I say this because I’ve been following Sami Maameri’s blog post which explains how to run an LLM on your own machine and ran into an error, which we’ll explore in this blog post.
Sami’s post is based around a library called GPT4All, but he also uses LangChain to glue things together.</description>

      <description>Somewhat belatedly, I’ve been playing around with LangChain and HuggingFace to spike a tool that lets me ask question about Tim Berglund’s Real-Time Analytics podcast.
I’m using the Chroma database to store vectors of chunks of the transcript so that I can find appropriate sections to feed to the Large Language Model to help with answering my questions. I ran into an initially perplexing error while building this out, which we’re going to explore in this blog post.</description>
