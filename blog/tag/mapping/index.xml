      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve previously written about some of the aspects of the mapping efforts that we&amp;rsquo;ve done on recent projects and what we&amp;rsquo;ve found from our testing (or lack of) around this type of code is that somewhere along the line you are going to have to check that you&amp;rsquo;re mapping these values correctly, be it in an automated test or just by manually checking that the correct values are being sent across our integration points and into other systems.</description>

      <description>As we know with software development with pretty much every decision we make or technology we choose there is a trade off that goes with making this choice as compared with choosing an alternative.
I first learnt this when working with Ade a couple of years ago and while I know it to be true, I had come to believe that some practices are just non-negotiable and we should look to apply them judiciously wherever possible.</description>
