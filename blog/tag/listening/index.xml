      <description>One of the first unusual (to me) things that I noticed from the trainers at ThoughtWorks University was that when they were listening to participants they would often ask questions and re-frame the participants&amp;#39; comments. Intrigued and impressed by this I spoke to one of the trainers and was told that they were engaging in &amp;#39;active listening&amp;#39;. Wikipedia defines the term as follows:
Active listening is an intent &amp;#34;listening for meaning&amp;#34; in which the listener checks with the speaker to see that a statement has been correctly heard and understood.</description>
