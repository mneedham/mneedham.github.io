      <description>One of the first unusual (to me) things that I noticed from the trainers at ThoughtWorks University was that when they were listening to participants they would often ask questions and re-frame the participants&amp;rsquo; comments. Intrigued and impressed by this I spoke to one of the trainers and was told that they were engaging in &amp;lsquo;active listening&amp;rsquo;. Wikipedia defines the term as follows:   Active listening is an intent &amp;ldquo;listening for meaning&amp;rdquo; in which the listener checks with the speaker to see that a statement has been correctly heard and understood.</description>
