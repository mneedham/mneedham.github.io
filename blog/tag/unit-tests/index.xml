      <description>A couple of my colleagues have been posting about how to name your unit tests based on this original post by Jay Fields.
I think that test names are useful, especially when written in a BDD style expressing what a test is supposed to be doing.
For example, in a C# NUnit test we might see the following as a test name:
[Test] public void ShouldDoSomething() { // Code testing that we&amp;#39;re doing something } I write all my tests like this and Iâ€™m often asked what the point of the &amp;#39;Should&amp;#39; is, why not just name it &amp;#39;DoSomething&amp;#39;.</description>
