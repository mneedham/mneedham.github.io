      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been building a little React app that uses the Semantic UI library and found myself wanting to render a custom icon.
 Semantic UI describes an icon as &#34;a glyph used to represent something else&#34;, and there are a big list of in built icons. For example, the following code renders a thumbs up icon:
 import {Icon} from &#34;semantic-ui-react&#34;; &amp;lt;Icon name=&#34;thumbs up outline icon green large&#34; style={{margin: 0}}/&amp;gt;    Figure 1.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working on a React Reach Router based application that has several routes and wanted to show a search box in the header unless the user was on the search page. After a lot of trial and error I learnt that I could use a route change event listener to do this.
 The CodeSandbox below shows all the code to do this:
  Let&amp;#8217;s walk through the code.</description>
