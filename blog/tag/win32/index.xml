      <description>We’ve been doing a bit of work around controlling the state of the windows of applications launched programmatically.
The problem we were trying to solve is to launch an arbitrary application, move it around the screen and then save its window position on the screen so that next time it’s launched it loads in the same position.
There are some win32 APIs designed to do just this, although it took a fair bit of searching and trial and error to work out exactly how to use them.</description>
