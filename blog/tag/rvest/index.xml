      <description>Given Wimbledon starts next week I wanted to find a data set to explore before it gets underway. Having searched around and failed to find one I had to resort to scraping the ATP World Tour&#39;s event page which displays the matches in an easy to access format. We&#39;ll be using the Wimbledon 2013 draw since Andy Murray won that year! This is what the page looks like:
  Each match is in its own row of a table and each column has a class attribute which makes it really easy to scrape.</description>
