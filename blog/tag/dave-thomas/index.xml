      <description>No coding dojo update this week as Dave Thomas was in the ThoughtWorks Sydney office to talk about Managing Lean and Agile in Large Software Development.
It was actually a talk to the Geek Girls Sydney group but I sneaked in to hear his other talk after listening to the cloud computing one last week.
It was a much toned down presentation compared to the cloud computing one although still amusing in places.</description>
