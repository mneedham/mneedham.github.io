      <description>Our technical book club this week focused on &#39;http://www.mockobjects.com/book/readability.html[The Readability of Tests]&#39; chapter from Steve Freeman &amp;amp; Nat Pryce&amp;#8217;s upcoming book &#39;http://www.mockobjects.com/book/index.html[Growing Object Oriented Software, guide by tests]&#39;.
 I&amp;#8217;ve been reading through some of the other chapters online and I thought this would be an interesting chapter to talk about as people seem to have different opinions on how DRY tests should be, how we build test data, how we name tests and so on.</description>
