      <description>In last week&amp;#8217;s book club we discussed an article written by Jeremy Miller for MSDN Magazine titled &#39;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc721605.aspx[Object Role Stereotypes]&#39; which discusses part of Rebecca Wirfs Brock&amp;#8217;s book &#39;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Object-Design-Responsibilities-Collaborations-Addison-Wesley/dp/0201379430/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1249549884&amp;amp;sr=8-1[Object Design]&#39;.
 I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to read Object Design for about a year since coming across the book while reading through the slides from JAOO Sydney 2008 but I&amp;#8217;ve often found the reading to be quite abstract and have struggled to work out how to apply the ideas to the coding I do day to day.</description>
