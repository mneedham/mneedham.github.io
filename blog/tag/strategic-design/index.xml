      <description>Reading through some of Simon Harris&amp;rsquo; blog entries I came across his thoughts on a presentation Eric Evans did at QCon titled &amp;lsquo;Strategic Design - Responsibility Traps&amp;rsquo; which seems to cover a lot of the ground from the second half of Domain Driven Design and more.
In the presentation Evans make some really insightful comments and points out a lot of mistakes that I&amp;rsquo;ve made on projects. It certainly serves as a reminder to go back and read part 4 of the book again and really understand the material from that section.</description>
