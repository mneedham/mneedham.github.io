      <description>I was playing around with neovim last week and despite installing it via Homebrew, ran into a weird permissions error. In this blog post, Iâ€™ll describe the problem I had and how to solve it.
I installed it like this:
brew install nvim And then tried to create a new file:
nvim foo.py Which resulted in the following error:
Output E303: Unable to create directory &amp;#34;/Users/markhneedham/.local/state/nvim&amp;#34; for swap file, recovery impossible: permission denied E303: Unable to open swap file for &amp;#34;foo.</description>
