      <description>As I mentioned in an earlier posta colleague and I spent a few days looking at how to connect to an OpenDSLDAP server using Ruby.
We ended up analysing four different solutions for solving the problem.
We had real problems trying to even connect to our OpenDS server using this library. We eventually found out that OpenDS is not actually listed as one of the supported interfaces.
The real benefit of this approach was that the library is written in Ruby meaning that getting permission to install it would be easier.</description>
