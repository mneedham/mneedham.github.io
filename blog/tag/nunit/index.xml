      <description>I recently started playing around with Scott Bellware’s Spec-Unit and Aaron’s Jensen’s MSpec, two frameworks which both provide a way of writing Context/Spec style tests/specifications.
What I particularly like about this approach to writing tests is that we can divide assertions into specific blocks and have them all evaluated even if an earlier one fails.
NUnit is our testing tool of choice at the moment and we wanted to try and find a way to test the mapping between the domain and service layers of the application.</description>
