      <description>We have been making good use of Hamcrestmatchers on my current project for making assertions, and have moved almost entirely away from the more traditional JUnit assertEquals approach.
There are several reasons why I find the Hamcrest matcher approach to be more productive - it&amp;rsquo;s more flexible, more expressive and when an assertion fails we have a much better idea about why it has failed than if we use a JUnit assertion for example.</description>
