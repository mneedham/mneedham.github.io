      <description>Over the last few days I&#39;ve been watching the chain of &#39;My name is...&#39; tweets kicked off by DHH with interest. As I understand it, the idea is to show that coding interview riddles/hard tasks on a whiteboard are ridiculous. Hello, my name is David. I would fail to write bubble sort on a whiteboard. I look code up on the internet all the time. I don&amp;#39;t do riddles.</description>

      <description>About 8 or 9 months ago I remember having a conversation with a colleague where I asked him where he had got his almost encyclopedic knowledge of all things software development.
His reply at the time was that he read a lot of blogs and that this was where he had picked up a lot of the information.
While subscribing to different blogs remains a useful way of learning about different aspects of software development, I think Twitter is now becoming a very useful complementary tool to use alongside the RSS reader.</description>
