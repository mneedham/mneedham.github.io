      <description>I&amp;#8217;m still getting used to the idea of following the logs when working out what&amp;#8217;s going wrong with distributed systems but it worked well when trying to work out why our puppet client which was throwing this error when we ran &#39;puppet agent -tdv&#39;:
 err: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on SERVER: Failed to submit &#39;replace catalog&#39; command for client to PuppetDB at puppetmaster:8081: [500 Server Error]   We were seeing the same error in /var/log/syslog on the puppet master and a quick look at the process list didn&amp;#8217;t show that the puppet master or puppetdb services were under a particularly heavy load.</description>
