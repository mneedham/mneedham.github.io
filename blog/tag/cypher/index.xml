      <description>I recently wanted to create a graph based on an adjacency list, and in this post we’ll learn how to do that using the FOREACH clause and then with the new CALL {} subquery clause.
We’ll start with the following map of ids → arrays of ids:
:param list =&amp;gt; ({`0`: [7, 9], `1`: [2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9], `2`: [0, 6, 8, 9], `3`: [1, 2, 6, 9], `4`: [1, 2, 3, 7], `5`: [8, 9], `6`: [2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9], `7`: [0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9], `8`: [1, 6, 9], `9`: [0, 1, 3, 5]}) We want to create one node per id and create a relationship from each node to the nodes in its array.</description>

      <description>Following on from the blog post where we compared how MPs and parties voted on Brexit indicative measures, in this post we’re going to explore how Conservative MPs have voted with respect to a no deal exit from the European Union. In particular we’d like to know whether the threat to have the party whip removed had an impact on how they voted in the recent motion to request an extension to work out a deal.</description>

      <description>In the previous post of the Graphing Brexit series we computed the average vote by party. In this post we’re going to take those average party scores and compare them against the votes placed by individual MPs. The goal is to determine whether, Brexit wise, MPs are representing the right party!
It won’t be perfect since we know that not everyone in a party voted the same way, but it should still give us some fun results.</description>

      <description>Over the last week I’ve revisited the Brexit Graph that I created in March 2019, this time looking at how the parties voted on average on each of the indicative votes.
To recap, we have a graph that has the following schema:
Since the initial post I’ve slightly changed how the MEMBER_OF relationship works. As several MPs have switched MPs in the intervening months, we’re now storing a start property to indicate when they started representing a party and an end property to indicate when they stopped representing a party.</description>

      <description>I’ve been playing with the Brexit Graph over the last few days, and wanted to map the MPs that I got from CommonsVotes with data from the TheyWorkForYou API.
I already had voting records loaded into Neo4j, but to recap, this is how I did that:
UNWIND [655,656,657,658,659,660,661,662,711, 669, 668, 667, 666, 664] AS division LOAD CSV FROM &amp;#34;https://github.com/mneedham/graphing-brexit/raw/master/data/commonsvotes/Division&amp;#34; + division + &amp;#34;.csv&amp;#34; AS row // Create motion nodes WITH division, collect(row) AS rows MERGE (motion:Motion {division: trim(split(rows[0][0], &amp;#34;:&amp;#34;)[1]) }) SET motion.</description>

      <description>The Neo4j APOC library&amp;#39;s Load CSV procedure is very useful if you want more control over the import process than the LOAD CSV clause allows. I found myself using it last week to import a CSV file of embeddings, because I wanted to know the line number of the row in the CSV file while importing the data.
I had a file that looked like this, which I put into the import directory:</description>

      <title>Neo4j: Cypher - Nested Path Comprehensions vs OPTIONAL MATCH</title>

      <description>While writing my previous post about Cypher nested path comprehensions, I realised that for this particular problem, the OPTIONAL MATCH clause is a better choice.
To recap, we have the following graph:
MERGE (club:Club {name: &amp;#34;Man Utd&amp;#34;}) MERGE (league:League {name: &amp;#34;Premier League&amp;#34;}) MERGE (country:Country {name: &amp;#34;England&amp;#34;}) MERGE (club)-[:IN_LEAGUE]-&amp;gt;(league) MERGE (league)-[:IN_COUNTRY]-&amp;gt;(country) MERGE (club2:Club {name: &amp;#34;Juventus&amp;#34;}) MERGE (league2:League {name: &amp;#34;Serie A&amp;#34;}) MERGE (club2)-[:IN_LEAGUE]-&amp;gt;(league2) We started the post with the following query that returns (club)-[:IN_LEAGUE]→(league)-[:IN_COUNTRY]→(country) paths:</description>

      <description>I’ve recently been building an application using the GRANDstack, which uses nested Cypher path comprehensions to translate GraphQL queries to Cypher ones. I’d not done this before, so I was quite curious how this feature worked. We’ll explore it using the following dataset:
MERGE (club:Club {name: &amp;#34;Man Utd&amp;#34;}) MERGE (league:League {name: &amp;#34;Premier League&amp;#34;}) MERGE (country:Country {name: &amp;#34;England&amp;#34;}) MERGE (club)-[:IN_LEAGUE]-&amp;gt;(league) MERGE (league)-[:IN_COUNTRY]-&amp;gt;(country) MERGE (club2:Club {name: &amp;#34;Juventus&amp;#34;}) MERGE (league2:League {name: &amp;#34;Serie A&amp;#34;}) MERGE (club2)-[:IN_LEAGUE]-&amp;gt;(league2) If we want to return a path containing a club, the league they play in, and the country that the league belongs to, we could write the following query:</description>

      <description>Sometimes we want to be able to vary our Cypher queries based on the value of a parameter. I came across such a situation today, and thought I’d share how I solved it using the APOC library.
Let’s first setup some sample data:
UNWIND range(0, 5) AS id CREATE (:Person {name: &amp;#34;person-&amp;#34; + id}) Now, if we want to get all pairs of people, we could write the following query:</description>

      <description>In this post we’ll learn how to write a Cypher query to create a node in Neo4j containing some of the keys from a map. This post assumes that the APOC library is installed.
We’ll start by creating a map that contains data from my twitter profile:
:param document =&amp;gt; { id: 14707949, name: &amp;#34;Mark Needham&amp;#34;, username: &amp;#34;markhneedham&amp;#34;, bio: &amp;#34;Developer Relations @neo4j&amp;#34;, location: &amp;#34;London, United Kingdom&amp;#34;, url: &amp;#34;http://www.markhneedham.com&amp;#34;, join_date: &amp;#34;8 May 2008&amp;#34;, join_time: &amp;#34;5:58 PM&amp;#34;, tweets: 24710, following: 2479, followers: 5054, likes: 1014 }; We want to create a User node based on this data, but we don’t want to use all of the keys in the map.</description>

      <description>When experimenting with a new database, at some stage we’ll probably want to delete all our data and start again. I was trying to do this with Neo4j over the weekend and it didn’t work as I expected, so I thought I’d write the lessons I learned.
We’ll be using Neo4j via the Neo4j Desktop with the default settings. This means that we have a maximum heap size of 1GB.</description>

      <description>Irfan and I were playing with a dataset earlier today, and having run a bunch of graph algorithms, we had a lot of properties that we wanted to clear out.
The following Cypher query puts Neo4j into the state that we were dealing with.

      <description>As part of a dataset I’ve been working with this week, I wanted to generate a collection of a range of dates using the Cypher query language.
I’ve previously used the duration function, which lets you add (or subtract) from a specific date, so I thought I’d start from there. If we want to find the day after 1st January 2019, we could write the following query:
neo4j&amp;gt; WITH date(&amp;#34;2019-01-01&amp;#34;) AS startDate RETURN startDate + duration({days: 1}) AS date; +------------+ | date | +------------+ | 2019-01-02 | +------------+ We can extend this code sample to find the next 5 dates from 1st January 2019 by using the range function:</description>

Importing the dataset If you want to try out the examples below you can execute the following LOAD CSV commands to load the data:

If you want to learn how to create your own Strava graph you should read my previous post, but just to recap, this is the graph model that we created:

If you want to follow along on your own data you’ll need to get an API key via the &amp;#39;My API Application&amp;#39; section of the website. Once you’ve got that put it in the TOKEN environment variable and you should be good to go.</description>

      <description>Continuing with my explorations of Strava data in Neo4j I wanted to share some things I learnt while trying to work out my pace for certain distances.
Before we get into the pace calculations let’s first understand how the duration function works. If we run the following query we might expect to get back the same value that we put in…​
RETURN duration({seconds: 413.77}).seconds AS seconds ╒═════════╕ │&amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34;│ ╞═════════╡ │413 │ └─────────┘ …​but as you can see the value gets rounded down to the nearest number, losing us some accuracy.</description>

      <description>In my last blog post I showed how to compare instances of Neo4j’s Duration data type, and in the middle of the post I realised that I needed to use the APOC library to return the value in the format I wanted. This was the solution I ended up with:
WITH duration({seconds: 100}) AS duration RETURN apoc.text.lpad(toString(duration.minutes), 2, &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;) + &amp;#34;:&amp;#34; + apoc.text.lpad(toString(duration.secondsOfMinute), 2, &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;) If we run that query this is the output:</description>

I’ll show how to load the whole Strava dataset in another blog post but for now we’ll just manually create some durations based on the elapsed time in seconds that Strava provides. We can run the following query to convert duration in seconds into the duration type:</description>

      <description>I recently upgraded a Neo4j backed application from Neo4j 3.2 to Neo4j 3.3 and came across an interesting change in behaviour around type coercion which led to my application throwing a bunch of errors.
In Neo4j 3.2 and earlier if you added a String to a Double it would coerce the Double to a String and concatenate the values. The following would therefore be valid Cypher:
RETURN toFloat(&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34;) + &amp;#34; Mark&amp;#34; ╒══════════╕ │&amp;#34;result&amp;#34; │ ╞══════════╡ │&amp;#34;1.</description>

      <description>I ran into an interesting Cypher error message earlier this week while trying to create an array property on a node which I thought I’d share.
This was the Cypher query I wrote:
CREATE (:Person {id: [1, &amp;#34;mark&amp;#34;, 2.0]}) which results in this error:
Neo.ClientError.Statement.TypeError Property values can only be of primitive types or arrays thereof. We actually are storing an array of primitives but we have a mix of different types which isn’t allowed.</description>

      <description>I had a problem on a graph I was working on recently where I’d managed to create duplicate nodes because I hadn’t applied any unique constraints.
I wanted to remove the duplicates, and came across Jimmy Ruts&amp;#39; excellent post which shows some ways to do this.
Let’s first create a graph with some duplicate nodes to play with:
UNWIND range(0, 100) AS id CREATE (p1:Person {id: toInteger(rand() * id)}) MERGE (p2:Person {id: toInteger(rand() * id)}) MERGE (p3:Person {id: toInteger(rand() * id)}) MERGE (p4:Person {id: toInteger(rand() * id)}) CREATE (p1)-[:KNOWS]-&amp;gt;(p2) CREATE (p1)-[:KNOWS]-&amp;gt;(p3) CREATE (p1)-[:KNOWS]-&amp;gt;(p4) Added 173 labels, created 173 nodes, set 173 properties, created 5829 relationships, completed after 408 ms.</description>

      <description>I was recently trying to create a map in a Cypher query but wanted to have dynamic keys in that map. I started off with this query:
WITH &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; as dynamicKey, &amp;#34;b&amp;#34; as dynamicValue RETURN { dynamicKey: dynamicValue } AS map ╒══════════════════╕ │&amp;#34;map&amp;#34; │ ╞══════════════════╡ │{&amp;#34;dynamicKey&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;b&amp;#34;}│ └──────────────────┘ Not quite what we want! We want dynamicKey to be evaluated rather than treated as a literal. As usual, APOC comes to the rescue!</description>

      <description>I was doing some data cleaning a few days ago and wanting to multiply a value by 1 million. My Cypher code to do this looked like this:
with &amp;#34;8.37&amp;#34; as rawNumeric RETURN toFloat(rawNumeric) * 1000000 AS numeric ╒═════════════════╕ │&amp;#34;numeric&amp;#34; │ ╞═════════════════╡ │8369999.999999999│ └─────────────────┘ Unfortunately that suffers from the classic rounding error when working with floating point numbers. I couldn’t figure out a way to solve it using pure Cypher, but there tends to be an APOC function to solve every problem and this was no exception.</description>

      <description>Over the last couple of weekends I’ve been playing around with some transport data and I wanted to run the A* algorithm to find the quickest route between two stations.
The A* algorithm takes an estimateEvaluator as one of its parameters and the evaluator looks at lat/longs of nodes to work out whether a path is worth following or not. I therefore needed to add lat/longs for each station and I found it surprisingly hard to find this location date for all the points in the dataset.</description>

      <description>One of the things I’ve often found frustrating when importing data using Cypher, Neo4j’s query language, is that it’s quite difficult to create dynamic relationship types.
Say we have a CSV file structured like this:
load csv with headers from &amp;#34;file:///people.csv&amp;#34; AS row RETURN row ╒═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╕ │row │ ╞═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╡ │{node1: Mark, node2: Reshmee, relationship: MARRIED_TO}│ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │{node1: Mark, node2: Alistair, relationship: FRIENDS} │ └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ We want to create nodes with the relationship type specified in the file.</description>

      <description>A couple of days I was trying to write a Cypher query to filter the labels in my database.

      <description>I’ve been building a graph of computer science papers on and off for a couple of months and now that I’ve got a few thousand loaded in I realised that there are quite a few duplicates.
They’re not duplicates in the sense that there are multiple entries with the same identifier but rather have different identifiers but seem to be the same paper!
e.g. there are a couple of papers titled &amp;#39;Authentication in the Taos operating system&amp;#39;:</description>

      <description>When writing Cypher queries I sometimes find myself wanting to remove consecutive duplicates in collections that I’ve joined together.
e.g we might start with the following query where 1 and 7 appear consecutively:
RETURN [1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,8] AS values ==&amp;gt; +-----------------------+ ==&amp;gt; | values | ==&amp;gt; +-----------------------+ ==&amp;gt; | [1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,8] | ==&amp;gt; +-----------------------+ ==&amp;gt; 1 row We want to end up with [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. We can start by exploding our array and putting consecutive elements next to each other:</description>

      <description>One of the Cypher language features we show in Neo4j training courses is the shortest path function which allows you to find the shortest path in terms of number of relationships between two nodes.
Using the movie graph, which you can import via the &amp;#39;:play movies&amp;#39; command in the browser, we’ll first create a &amp;#39;KNOWS&amp;#39; relationship between any people that have appeared in the same movie:
MATCH (p1:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-&amp;gt;()&amp;lt;-[:ACTED_IN]-(p2:Person) MERGE (p1)-[:KNOWS]-(p2) Now that we’ve got that relationship we can easily find the shortest path between two people, say Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks:</description>

We’ll have an array of friends that we want to connect to a single Person node. Assuming the following schema…​
$ schema Indexes ON :Person(id) ONLINE No constraints …​a simplified version would look like this:
WITH range (2,1002) AS friends MERGE (p:Person {id: 1}) FOREACH(f IN friends | MERGE (friend:Person {id: f}) MERGE (friend)-[:FRIENDS]-&amp;gt;p); If we execute that on an empty database we’ll see something like this:</description>

      <description>While building up the Neo4j World Cup Graph I’ve been making use of the http://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-2-1-graph-etl function and I frequently found myself needing to do different things depending on the value in one of the columns.
For example I have one CSV file which contains the different events that can happen in a football match:
match_id,player,player_id,time,type &amp;#34;1012&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Antonin Panenka&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;174835&amp;#34;,21,&amp;#34;penalty&amp;#34; &amp;#34;1012&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Faisal Al Dakhil&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;2204&amp;#34;,57,&amp;#34;goal&amp;#34; &amp;#34;102&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Roger Milla&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;79318&amp;#34;,106,&amp;#34;goal&amp;#34; &amp;#34;102&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Roger Milla&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;79318&amp;#34;,108,&amp;#34;goal&amp;#34; &amp;#34;102&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Bernardo Redin&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;44555&amp;#34;,115,&amp;#34;goal&amp;#34; &amp;#34;102&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Andre Kana-biyik&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;174649&amp;#34;,44,&amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; If the type is &amp;#39;penalty&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;owngoal&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;goal&amp;#39; then I want to create a SCORED_GOAL relationship whereas if it’s &amp;#39;yellow&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;yellowred&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;red&amp;#39; then I want to create a RECEIVED_CARD relationship instead.</description>

Let’s say we’ve created a timetree up front and now have a series of events coming in that we want to create in the database and attach to the appropriate part of the timetree.</description>

      <description>About 6 months ago Jacqui Read created a github issue explaining how she wanted to round a float value to a number of decimal places but was unable to do so due to the http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/query-functions-mathematical.html#functions-round function not taking the appropriate parameter.
I found myself wanting to do the same thing last week where I initially had the following value:
RETURN toFloat(&amp;#34;12.336666&amp;#34;) AS value I wanted to round that to 2 decimal places and Wes suggested multiplying the value before using ROUND and then dividing afterwards to achieve that.</description>

Without the UNWIND clause we’d have to do this:

      <description>I was recently reminded of a Neo4j cypher query that I wrote a couple of years ago to find the colleagues that I hadn’t worked with in the ThoughtWorks London office.
The model looked like this:
And I created the following fake data set of the aforementioned model:
public class SetBasedOperations { private static final Label PERSON = DynamicLabel.label( &amp;#34;Person&amp;#34; ); private static final Label OFFICE = DynamicLabel.label( &amp;#34;Office&amp;#34; ); private static final DynamicRelationshipType COLLEAGUES = DynamicRelationshipType.</description>

      <description>Last week Alistair and I were porting some Neo4j cypher queries from 1.8 to 2.0 and one of the queries we had to change was an interesting one that created a bunch of relationships from a list/array of maps.
In the query we had a user &amp;#39;Mark&amp;#39; and wanted to create &amp;#39;FRIENDS_WITH&amp;#39; relationships to Peter and Michael.
The application passed in a list of maps representing Peter and Michael as a parameter but if we remove the parameters the query looked like this:</description>

      <description>One of the features added into the more recent versions of Neo4j’s cypher query language is the ability to tell Cypher which index you’d like to use in your queries.
We’ll use the football dataset, so let’s start by creating an index on the &amp;#39;name&amp;#39; property of nodes labelled &amp;#39;Player&amp;#39;:
CREATE INDEX ON :Player(name) Let’s say we want to write a query to find &amp;#39;Wayne Rooney&amp;#39; while explicitly using this index.</description>

      <description>One of the breaking changes in Neo4j 2.0.0-RC1 compared to previous versions is that the -[?]-&amp;gt; syntax for matching optional relationships has been retired and replaced with the http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/query-optional-match.html construct.
An example where we might want to match an optional relationship could be if we want to find colleagues that we haven’t worked with given the following model:
Suppose we have the following data set:
CREATE (steve:Person {name: &amp;#34;Steve&amp;#34;}) CREATE (john:Person {name: &amp;#34;John&amp;#34;}) CREATE (david:Person {name: &amp;#34;David&amp;#34;}) CREATE (paul:Person {name: &amp;#34;Paul&amp;#34;}) CREATE (sam:Person {name: &amp;#34;Sam&amp;#34;}) CREATE (londonOffice:Office {name: &amp;#34;London Office&amp;#34;}) CREATE UNIQUE (steve)-[:WORKS_IN]-&amp;gt;(londonOffice) CREATE UNIQUE (john)-[:WORKS_IN]-&amp;gt;(londonOffice) CREATE UNIQUE (david)-[:WORKS_IN]-&amp;gt;(londonOffice) CREATE UNIQUE (paul)-[:WORKS_IN]-&amp;gt;(londonOffice) CREATE UNIQUE (sam)-[:WORKS_IN]-&amp;gt;(londonOffice) CREATE UNIQUE (steve)-[:COLLEAGUES_WITH]-&amp;gt;(john) CREATE UNIQUE (steve)-[:COLLEAGUES_WITH]-&amp;gt;(david) We might write the following query to find people from the same office as Steve but that he hasn’t worked with:</description>

      <description>We recently released Neo4j 2.0.0-RC1 and since there were some breaking changes from Neo4j 2.0.0-M06 I decided to check if I needed to update any of my football graph queries.
On query which no longer worked as I expected was the following one which calculated the top goal scorers for televised games:
MATCH (player:Player)-[:played|subbed_on]-&amp;gt;stats WITH stats.goals AS goals, player, stats-[:in]-&amp;gt;()-[:on_tv]-() as onTv RETURN player.name, SUM(CASE WHEN onTv = FALSE THEN goals ELSE 0 END) as nonTvGoals, SUM(CASE WHEN onTv = TRUE THEN goals ELSE 0 END) as tvGoals, SUM(goals) as allGoals ORDER BY tvGoals DESC LIMIT 10 This is what that section of the graph looks like visually:</description>

      <description>I want to introduce the concept of a season into my graph so I can have import matches for multiple years and then vary the time period which queries take into account.
I started by creating season nodes like this:
CREATE (:Season {name: &amp;#34;2013/2014&amp;#34;, timestamp: 1375315200}) CREATE (:Season {name: &amp;#34;2012/2013&amp;#34;, timestamp: 1343779200}) CREATE (:Season {name: &amp;#34;2011/2012&amp;#34;, timestamp: 1312156800}) CREATE (:Season {name: &amp;#34;2010/2011&amp;#34;, timestamp: 1280620800}) CREATE (:Season {name: &amp;#34;2009/2010&amp;#34;, timestamp: 1249084800}) I wanted to add a &amp;#39;NEXT&amp;#39; relationship between the seasons so that I could have an in graph season index which would allow me to write queries like the following:</description>

      <description>I was looking back over some of the queries I wrote for my football data set and I came across one I’d written to work out how many goals players scored in matches that were televised.
The data model looks like this:
My initial query to work out the top 10 scorers in televised games was as follows:
MATCH (player:Player) WITH player MATCH player-[:played|subbed_on]-&amp;gt;stats-[:in]-&amp;gt;game-[t?:on_tv]-&amp;gt;channel WITH COLLECT({goals: stats.goals, type: TYPE(t)}) AS games, player RETURN player.</description>

      <description>I’ve been playing around with the most recent Neo4j 2.0 milestone release - 2.0.0-M05 - and one of the first things I did was translate the queries from my football data set which were written against Neo4j 1.9.
The following query calculates the number of goals scored by players in matches that were shown on television, not on television and in total.
START player=node:players(&amp;#39;name:*&amp;#39;) MATCH player-[:played|subbed_on]-&amp;gt;stats-[:in]-&amp;gt;game-[t?:on_tv]-&amp;gt;channel WITH COLLECT([stats.goals, TYPE(t)]) AS games, player RETURN player.</description>

      <description>I was looking back over some cypher queries I’d written earlier in the year against my football data set to find some examples of where list comprehensions could be useful and I came across this query which is used to work out which teams were the most badly behaved in terms of accumulating red and yellow cards:
START team = node:teams(&amp;#39;name:*&amp;#39;) MATCH team&amp;lt;-[:for]-like_this&amp;lt;-[:started|as_sub]-player-[r?:sent_off_in|booked_in]-&amp;gt;game&amp;lt;-[:in]-like_this WITH team, COLLECT(r) AS cards WITH team, FILTER(x IN cards: TYPE(x) = &amp;#34;sent_off_in&amp;#34;) AS reds, FILTER(x IN cards: TYPE(x) = &amp;#34;booked_in&amp;#34;) AS yellows RETURN team.</description>

      <description>For as long as I’ve been using neo4j&amp;#39;s cypher query language Michael has been telling me to use parameters in my queries but the performance of the queries was always acceptable so I didn’t feel the need.
However, recently I was playing around with a data set and I created ~500 nodes using code similar to this:
require &amp;#39;open-uri&amp;#39; open(&amp;#34;data/people.cyp&amp;#34;, &amp;#39;w&amp;#39;) { |f| (1..500).each do |value| f.puts(&amp;#34;CREATE (p:Person{name: \&amp;#34;#{value}\&amp;#34;})&amp;#34;) end } That creates a file of cypher statements that look like this:</description>

The model looked like this:
which we can create with the following cypher statements:
CREATE (email1 { name: &amp;#39;Email 1&amp;#39;, title: &amp;#39;Some stuff&amp;#39; }) CREATE (email2 { name: &amp;#39;Email 2&amp;#39;, title: &amp;#34;Absolutely irrelevant&amp;#34; }) CREATE (email3 { name: &amp;#39;Email 3&amp;#39;, title: &amp;#34;Something else&amp;#34; }) CREATE (person1 { name: &amp;#39;Mark&amp;#39; }) CREATE (person2 { name: &amp;#39;Jim&amp;#39; }) CREATE (person3 { name: &amp;#39;Alistair&amp;#39; }) CREATE (person1)-[:SENT]-&amp;gt;(email1) CREATE (person2)-[:RECEIVED]-&amp;gt;(email1) CREATE (person3)-[:RECEIVED]-&amp;gt;(email1) CREATE (person1)-[:SENT]-&amp;gt;(email2) CREATE (person2)-[:RECEIVED]-&amp;gt;(email2) CREATE (person2)-[:SENT]-&amp;gt;(email3) CREATE (person1)-[:RECEIVED]-&amp;gt;(email3) We want to return a list containing pairs of people and how many times they emailed each other, so in this case we want to return a table showing the following:</description>

      <description>The neo4j docs have a few examples explaining how to to write cypher queries dealing with path ranges but an interesting variation that I came across recently is where we want to find the individual hops in a path.
I thought the managers that Chelsea have had since Roman Abramovich took over would serve as a useful data set to show how this works.
So we create all the managers and a &amp;#39;SUCCEEDED_BY&amp;#39; relationship between them as follows:</description>

      <description>neo4j uses Lucene to handle indexing of nodes and relationships in the graph but something that can be a bit confusing at first is how to handle special characters in Lucene queries.
For example let’s say we set up a database with the following data:
CREATE ({name: &amp;#34;-one&amp;#34;}) CREATE ({name: &amp;#34;-two&amp;#34;}) CREATE ({name: &amp;#34;-three&amp;#34;}) CREATE ({name: &amp;#34;four&amp;#34;}) And for whatever reason we only wanted to return the nodes that begin with a hyphen.</description>

The date modelling is based on an approach I first came across in a shutl presentation and is described in more detail in the docs.
I created a dummy data set with some made up appointments and dismissals and then tried to write a query to show me who was the manager for a team on a specific date.</description>

      <description>I’ve written previously about how I’ve converted properties on nodes into relationships and over the past week there was an interesting discussion on the neo4j mailing list about where each is appropriate.
Jim gives quite a neat summary of the difference between the two on the thread:
Properties are the data that an entity like a node [or relationship] holds. Relationships simply form the semantic glue (type, direction, cardinality) between nodes.</description>

CREATE (cat { name: &amp;#34;Cat&amp;#34; }) CREATE (subcat1 { name: &amp;#34;SubCat1&amp;#34; }) CREATE (subcat2 { name: &amp;#34;SubCat2&amp;#34; }) CREATE (subsubcat1 { name: &amp;#34;SubSubCat1&amp;#34; }) CREATE (product1 { name: &amp;#34;Product1&amp;#34; }) CREATE (cat)-[:CHILD]-subcat1-[:CHILD]-subsubcat1 CREATE (product1)-[:HAS_CATEGORY]-(subsubcat1) I wanted to write a query which would return &amp;#39;product1&amp;#39; and the tree &amp;#39;Cat -&amp;gt; SubCat1 -&amp;gt; SubSubCat1&amp;#39; and initially wrote the following query:</description>

      <description>I’ve been trying to see if I can match some of the football stats that OptaJoe posts on twitter and one that I was looking at yesterday was around the number of red cards different teams have received.
1 - Sunderland have picked up their first PL red card of the season. The only team without one now are Man Utd. Angels.
To refresh this is the sub graph that we’ll need to look at to work it out:</description>

      <description>Last week I was writing a query to find the top scorers in the Premier League so far this season alongside the number of games they’ve played in which initially read like this:
START player = node:players(&amp;#39;name:*&amp;#39;) MATCH player-[:started|as_sub]-playedLike-[:in]-game-[r?:scored_in]-player WITH player, COUNT(DISTINCT game) AS games, COLLECT(r) AS allGoals RETURN player.name, games, LENGTH(allGoals) AS goals ORDER BY goals DESC LIMIT 5 +------------------------------------+ | player.name | games | goals | +------------------------------------+ | &amp;#34;Luis Suárez&amp;#34; | 30 | 22 | | &amp;#34;Robin Van Persie&amp;#34; | 30 | 19 | | &amp;#34;Gareth Bale&amp;#34; | 27 | 17 | | &amp;#34;Michu&amp;#34; | 29 | 16 | | &amp;#34;Demba Ba&amp;#34; | 28 | 15 | +------------------------------------+ 5 rows 1 ms I modelled whether a player started a game or came on as a substitute with separate relationship types &amp;#39;started&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;as_sub&amp;#39; but in this query we’re not interested in that, we just want to know whether they played.</description>

      <description>The latest thing that I added to my football graph was the matches that are shown on TV as I have the belief that players who score on televised games get more attention than players who score in other games.
I thought it’d be interesting to work out who the top scorers are on each of these game types.
I added the following relationship type to allow me to do this:</description>

I started out with a query which grouped the data set by day and showed the opponents that were played on that day:

I wanted to find out whether Luis Suárez has a better scoring record depending on which day a match is played on.
We start out by finding all the matches that he’s played in and which days those matches were on:</description>

      <description>One of the things that I wanted to add to my football graph was something location related so I could try out neo4j spatial and I thought the easiest way to do that was to model the location of football stadiums.
To start with I needed to add spatial as an unmanaged extension to my neo4j plugins folder which involved doing the following:
$ git clone git://github.com/neo4j/spatial.git spatial $ cd spatial $ mvn clean package -Dmaven.</description>

      <description>I spent some of the weekend working my way through Jim, Ian &amp;amp; Emil&amp;#39;s book &amp;#39;Graph Databases&amp;#39; and one of the things that they emphasise is that graphs allow us to make relationships first class citizens in our model.
Looking back on a couple of the graphs that I modelled last year I realise that I didn’t quite get this and although the graphs I modelled had some relationships a lot of the time I was defining things as properties on nodes.</description>

I started off with a query that returned all the penalties that have been missed this season and the games those misses happened in:
START player = node:players(&amp;#39;name:*&amp;#39;) MATCH player-[:missed_penalty_in]-game, player-[:played|subbed_on]-stats-[:in]-game, stats-[:for]-team, game-[:home_team]-home, game-[:away_team]-away RETURN player.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a previous post I’ve been playing around with some football related data over the last few days and one query I ran (using cypher) was to find all the players who’ve been sent off this season in the Premiership.
The model in the graph around sending offs looks like this:
My initial query looked like this:
START player = node:players(&amp;#39;name:*&amp;#39;) MATCH player-[:sent_off_in]-game-[:in_month]-month RETURN player.name, month.name First we get the names of all the players which are stored in an index and then we follow relationships to the games they were sent off in and then find which months those games were played in.</description>

      <description>Last year I wrote a post describing how I’d gone about getting data for my ThoughtWorks graph and one mistake about my approach in retrospect is that I filtered the data too early.
My workflow looked like this:
Scrape internal application using web driver and save useful data to JSON files
Parse JSON files and load nodes/relationships into neo4j
The problem with the first step is that I was trying to determine up front what data was useful and as a result I ended up running the scrapping application multiple times when I realised I didn’t have all the data I wanted.</description>

      <description>In some of the recent work I’ve been doing with neo4j the queries I’ve written have been summing up the values from multiple nodes and after a certain number is reached the value returned used scientific notation.
For example in a cypher query like this:
START category = node:categories(&amp;#39;category_id:1&amp;#39;) MATCH p = category-[:has_child*1..5]-&amp;gt;subCategory-[:has_product]-&amp;gt;product-[:sold]-&amp;gt;sales RETURN EXTRACT(n in NODES(p) : n.category_id?),subCategory.category_id, SUM(sales.sales) I might get a result set like this:

I was trying to make use of the &amp;#39;CREATE UNIQUE&amp;#39; syntax which allows you to create nodes/relationships if they’re missing but won’t do anything if they already exists.
I had something like the following:</description>

The most interesting things we can explore relate to the relationship between people and the offices.
The model around people and offices looks like this:
I added a &amp;#39;current_home_office&amp;#39; relationship to make it easier to quickly get to the nodes of people who are currently working in a specific office.</description>

In the comments Josh Adell gave me the following advice:
The neat things about graphs is that multiple subgraphs can live in the same data-space. ... Keep your data model rich! Don’t be afraid to have as many relationships as you need. The power of graph databases comes from finding surprising results when you have strongly interconnected data.</description>

      <description>I was looking back at some code I wrote a few months ago to query a neo4j database to find the shortest path between two people via the colleagues relationships that exist.
&amp;lt;/img&amp;gt;
The initial code, written using neography, looked like this:
neo = Neography::Rest.new start_node = neo.get_node(start_node_id) destination_node = neo.get_node(destination_node_id) neo.get_paths(start_node, destination_node, { &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; =&amp;gt; &amp;#34;colleagues&amp;#34; }, depth = 3, algorithm = &amp;#34;shortestPath&amp;#34;) The neography code eventually makes a POST request to /node/{start_id}/paths and provides a JSON payload containing the other information about the query.</description>

      <description>At ThoughtWorks we don’t have line managers but people can choose to have a sponsor - typically someone who has worked in the company for longer/has more experience in the industry than them - who can help them navigate the organisation better.
From hearing people talk about sponsors over the last 6 years it seemed like quite a few people sponsored the majority and there were probably a few people who didn’t have a sponsor.</description>

One thing I wanted to do was work out which node is the most connected on the graph, which would tell me who’s worked with the most people.
I started off with the following cypher query:

As a result I had to update a traversal I’d written for finding the shortest path between two people in the graph.
The original traversal query I had was really simple because I had a direct connection between the people nodes:</description>
