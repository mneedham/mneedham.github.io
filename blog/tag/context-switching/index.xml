      <description>I’ve spent most of my time working on agile software development teams over the last few years so for the most part each pair is only working on one story, keeping the work in progress low and allowing them to focus on that piece of work until it’s completed.
My pair and I ended up in a therefore somewhat unusual situation last week where we were attempting to work on three things at the same time and weren’t doing a particularly great job on any of them.</description>
