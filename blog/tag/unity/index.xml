      <description>I spent a bit of time reading some of the Unity code base recently and I decided to try out a variation of Michael Feathers &amp;#39;Effect Sketching&amp;#39; which my colleague Dave Cameron showed me.
&amp;#39;Effect Sketching&amp;#39; is a technique Feathers describes in &amp;#39;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;#39; and the idea is that we sketch a diagram showing the interactions between the fields and methods in a specific class while browsing through the code.</description>
