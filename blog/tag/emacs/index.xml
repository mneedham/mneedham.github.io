      <description>Ever since I started using the Emacs + nrepl combination to play around with Clojure I&amp;#8217;ve been getting fairly non descript error messages whenever I pass the wrong parameters to a function.
 For example if I try to update a non existent key in a form I get a Null Pointer Exception:
 &amp;gt; (update-in {} [:mark] inc) NullPointerException clojure.lang.Numbers.ops (Numbers.java:942)   In this case it&amp;#8217;s clear that the hash doesn&amp;#8217;t have a key &#39;:mark&#39; so the function blows up.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been complaining recently to Jen and Bruce about the lack of a beginner&amp;#8217;s guide to emacs paredit mode which seems to be the defacto approach for people working with Clojure and both pointed me to the paredit cheat sheet.
 While it&amp;#8217;s very comprehensive, I found that it&amp;#8217;s a little overwhelming for a complete newbie like myself.
 I therefore thought it&amp;#8217;d be useful to write a bit about a couple of things that I&amp;#8217;ve picked up from pairing with Jen on little bits of Clojure over the last couple of months.</description>

      <title>Emacs: Re-mapping the Control and Meta Keys on Mac OS X</title>

      <description>Since I&amp;#8217;ve started playing around with Clojure again I thought it&amp;#8217;d make sense to use emacs as my editor and therefore needed to work out how to remap the Ctrl and Meta to keys which are more accessible on the MBP&amp;#8217;s keyboard.
 I&amp;#8217;ve found that I like using the Caps Lock for Ctrl and that&amp;#8217;s reasonably easy to change by navigating to &#39;System Preferences &amp;gt; Keyboard &amp;gt; Modifier Keys&#39;:</description>
