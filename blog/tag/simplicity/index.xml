      <description>One of the most unexpected things that I picked up while pairing with Ashok for a few days in August/September is his ability to pick the simplest solution when confronted with a problem.
On numerous occasions we&amp;rsquo;d be trying to do something and I&amp;rsquo;d end up on a yak shaving mission trying to get a complicated approach to work while he watched on with bemusement.
I thought I&amp;rsquo;d actually learnt this lesson from working with Ashok but on a couple of occasions over the last week I&amp;rsquo;ve caught myself doing the same thing again!</description>
