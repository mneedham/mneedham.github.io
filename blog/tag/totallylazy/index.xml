      <description>A couple of weeks ago Channing Walton tweeted the following:
  Every time you call get on an Option a kitten dies.
   As Channing points out in the comments he was referring to unguarded calls to &#39;get&#39; which would lead to an exception if the Option was empty, therefore pretty much defeating the point of using an Option in the first place!
 We&amp;#8217;re using Dan Bodart&amp;#8217;s totallylazy library on the application I&amp;#8217;m currently working on and in fact were calling &#39;get&#39; on an Option so I wanted to see if we could get rid of it.</description>
