      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s dojo involved coding a familiar problem - the bowling game - in a different language, Groovy.
The code we wrote is available on bitbucket.
The Format Cam, Dean and I took turns pairing with each other with the code projected onto a TV. As there were only a few of us the discussion on where we were taking the code tended to included everyone rather than just the two at the keyboard.</description>
