      <description>A month ago I wrote a post describing an approach my team has been taking to avoid premature abstractions whereby we leave code inline until we know enough about the domain to pull out meaningful classes or methods.
 Since I wrote that post we&amp;#8217;ve come across a couple of examples where there doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be a name to describe a data structure.
 We are building a pricing engine where the input is a set of configurations and the output is a set of pricing rows associated with each configuration.</description>
