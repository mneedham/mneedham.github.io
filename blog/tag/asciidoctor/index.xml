      <description>I’ve been using asciidoctor-pdf to generate PDF and while I was initially running the tool locally I eventually decided to setup a build on TeamCity.
It was a bit trickier than I expected, mostly because I’m not that familiar with deploying Ruby applications, but I thought I’d capture what I’ve done for future me.
I have the following Gemfile that installs asciidoctor-pdf and its dependencies:
Gemfile
source &amp;#39;https://rubygems.org&amp;#39; gem &amp;#39;prawn&amp;#39; gem &amp;#39;addressable&amp;#39; gem &amp;#39;prawn-svg&amp;#39; gem &amp;#39;prawn-templates&amp;#39; gem &amp;#39;asciidoctor-pdf&amp;#39; I don’t have permissions to install gems globally on the build agents so I’m bundling those up into the vendor directory.</description>

      <description>I’ve been writing the TWIN4j blog for almost a year now and during that time I’ve written a few different asciidoc macros to avoid repetition.
The most recent one I wrote does the formatting around the Featured Community Member of the Week. I call it like this from the asciidoc, passing in the name of the person and a link to an image:

      <description>One of my favourite features in AsciiDoc is the ability to include other files, but when using lots of includes is that it becomes difficult to read the whole document unless you convert it to one of the supported backends.
$ asciidoctor --help Usage: asciidoctor [OPTION]... FILE... Translate the AsciiDoc source FILE or FILE(s) into the backend output format (e.g., HTML 5, DocBook 4.5, etc.) By default, the output is written to a file with the basename of the source file and the appropriate extension.</description>
