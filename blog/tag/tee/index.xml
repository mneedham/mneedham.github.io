      <title>Unix: tee</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve read about the Unix &#39;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_(command)[tee]&#39; command before but never found a reason to use it until the last few weeks.
 One of the things I repeatedly do by mistake is open /etc/hosts without sudo and then try to make changes to it:
 $ vi /etc/hosts # Editing it leads to the dreaded &#39;W10: Changing a readonly file&#39;   I always used to close the file and then re-open it with sudo but I recently came across an approach which allows us to use &#39;tee&#39; to get around the problem.</description>
