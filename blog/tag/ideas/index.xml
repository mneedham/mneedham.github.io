      <description>I am a big fan of Pat Kuaâ€™s tiny tasks and to see my desk would be to believe that there had been an invasion of yellow stickies on the planet.
Pat explains the idea on his website but to summarise; the idea is that given a story, you break it down into the individual tasks that need to be done in order for it to be complete, write each tasks on a sticky and then when that task is finished throw the sticky away.</description>
