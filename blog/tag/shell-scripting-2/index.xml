      <description>The day before Graph Connect Europe 2016 we needed to create a bunch of USB sticks containing Neo4j and the training materials and eventually iterated our way to a half decent approach which made use of the GNU parallel command which I’ve always wanted to use!
But first I needed to get a USB hub so I could do lots of them at the same time. I bought the EasyAcc USB 3.</description>

      <title>SSHing onto machines via a jumpbox</title>

      <description>We wanted to be able to ssh into some machines which were behind a firewall so we set up a jumpbox which our firewall directed any traffic on port 22 towards.
Initially if we wanted to SSH onto a machine inside the network we’d have to do a two step process:
$ ssh jumpbox # now on the jumpbx $ ssh internal-network-machine That got a bit annoying after a while so Sam showed us a neat way of proxying the second ssh command through the first one by making use of netcat.</description>

      <title>VCloud Guest Customization Script : [: postcustomization: unexpected operator</title>

      <description>We have been doing some work to automatically provision machines using the VCloud API via fog and one of the things we wanted to do was run a custom script the first time that a node powers on.
The following explains how customization scripts work:
In vCloud Director, when setting a customization script in a virtual machine, the script:
Is called only on initial customization and force recustomization.
Is called with the precustomization command line parameter before out-of-box customization begins.</description>

      <title>Learning Unix find: Searching in/Excluding certain folders</title>

      <description>I love playing around with commands on the Unix shell but one of the ones that I’ve found the most difficult to learn beyond the very basics is http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?find.
I think this is partially because I find the find man page quite difficult to read and partially because it’s usually quicker to work out how to solve my problem with a command I already know than to learn another one.</description>

      <description>I’ve been playing around with mounting a Windows file share onto my machine via the terminal because I’m getting bored of constantly having to go to Finder and manually mounting it each time!
After a couple of times of mounting and unmounting the drive I ended up with this error:
&amp;gt; mount_smbfs //mneedham@punedc02/shared punedc02_shared/ mount_smbfs: mount error: /Volumes/punedc02_shared: File exists I originally thought the &amp;#39;file exists&amp;#39; part of the message was suggesting that I’d already mounted a share on &amp;#39;punedc02_shared&amp;#39; but calling the &amp;#39;umount&amp;#39; command led to the following error:</description>

      <description>A few days ago I wrote about how we’d been using Sed to edit multiple files and while those examples were derived from what we’d been using on Ubuntu I realised that they didn’t actually work on Mac OS X.
For example, the following command:
sed -i &amp;#39;s/require/include/&amp;#39; Rakefile Throws this error:
sed: 1: &amp;#34;Rakefile&amp;#34;: invalid command code R What I hadn’t realised is that on the Mac version of sed the &amp;#39;-i&amp;#39; flag has a mandatory suffix, as described in this post.</description>

      <title>Sed across multiple files</title>

      <description>Pankhuri and I needed to rename a method and change all the places where it was used and decided to see if we could work out how to do it using sed.
We needed to change a method call roughly like this:
home_link(current_user) To instead read:
homepage_path For which we need the following sed expression:
sed -i &amp;#39;s/home_link([^)]*)/homepage_path/&amp;#39; [file_name] Which works pretty well if you know which file you want to change but we wanted to run it over the whole code base.</description>

      <title>A dirty hack to get around aliases not working in a shell script</title>

      <description>In another script I’ve been working on lately I wanted to call &amp;#39;mysql&amp;#39; but unfortunately on my machine it’s &amp;#39;mysql5&amp;#39; rather than &amp;#39;mysql&amp;#39;.
I have an alias defined in &amp;#39;~/.bash_profile&amp;#39; so I can call &amp;#39;mysql&amp;#39; from the terminal whenever I want to.
alias mysql=mysql5 Unfortunately shell scripts don’t seem to have access to this alias and the only suggestion I’ve come across while googling this is to source &amp;#39;~/.bash_profile&amp;#39; inside the script.</description>
