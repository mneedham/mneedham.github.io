      <description>I’ve been building a little demo with dbt and DuckDB to transform CSV files from Jeff Sackmann’s tennis dataset and ran into an error that initially puzzled me. In this blog post, we’ll learn how to deal with it.
But first things first, we’re going to install dbt-duckdb as well as the latest version of DuckDB, which at the time of writing is 0.9.0.
pip install dbt-duckdb duckdb I then cloned Mehdi Ouazza’s demo project and adjusted it to work with my dataset.</description>
