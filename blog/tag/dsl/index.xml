      <description>I recently came across an interesting post by Dave Thomas where he discussed several domain specific languages (DSLs) he&amp;rsquo;s come across and suggests that a lot of them seem to be trying too hard to read like the english language instead of focusing on describing a vocabulary for their specific domain
Reading this post reminded me that I fell into this trap earlier in the year while doing some work to create a builder pattern in our code which didn&amp;rsquo;t need to make use of a &amp;lsquo;Build&amp;rsquo; method but instead would make use of C#&amp;rsquo;s implicit operator to automatically convert the builder to an object at the appropriate moment.</description>
