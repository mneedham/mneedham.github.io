      <description>I recently came across an interesting post by Dave Thomas where he discussed several domain specific languages (DSLs) he&amp;#8217;s come across and suggests that a lot of them seem to be trying too hard to read like the english language instead of focusing on describing a vocabulary for their specific domain
 Reading this post reminded me that I fell into this trap earlier in the year while doing some work to create a builder pattern in our code which didn&amp;#8217;t need to make use of a &#39;Build&#39; method but instead would make use of C#&#39;s implicit operator to automatically convert the builder to an object at the appropriate moment.</description>
