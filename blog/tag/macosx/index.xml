      <description>About a month ago I wrote about some problems I was having working with Windows generated CSV files which had a Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the file and I described a way to get rid of it using awk.
 It&amp;#8217;s a bit of a long winded process though and I always forget what the parameters I need to pass to awk are so I thought it would probably be quicker if I could just work out a way to get rid of the BOM using an editor.</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;#8217;ve started playing around with Clojure again I thought it&amp;#8217;d make sense to use emacs as my editor and therefore needed to work out how to remap the Ctrl and Meta to keys which are more accessible on the MBP&amp;#8217;s keyboard.
 I&amp;#8217;ve found that I like using the Caps Lock for Ctrl and that&amp;#8217;s reasonably easy to change by navigating to &#39;System Preferences &amp;gt; Keyboard &amp;gt; Modifier Keys&#39;:</description>
