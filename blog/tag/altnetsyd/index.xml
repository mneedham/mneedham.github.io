      <description>James Crisp and Richard Banks arranged the first Alt.NET Sydney User Group meeting held on Tuesday night at the ThoughtWorks office.
 The first thing to say is thanks to James and Richard for getting this setup so quickly - it was less than a month ago that Richard suggested the idea of creating a group on the Alt.NET mailing list.
 Richard and James have already written summaries of what went on but I thought I&amp;#8217;d give some of my thoughts as well.</description>
