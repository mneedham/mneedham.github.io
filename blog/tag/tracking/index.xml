      <description>I touched earlier on the transparency of agile and I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about some of the ways that we track/report information in agile projects.
In all the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in the data being tracked almost exclusively referred to development time. One of the advantages of having continuous analysis/development/testing is that we are able to reduce the time spent on the System Integration and User Acceptance Testing phases of the project.</description>
