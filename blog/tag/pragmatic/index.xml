      <description>Pragmatic Learning and Thinkingby Andy HuntI came across this book when reading a post linking lean to the Dreyfus Modelon Dan North&amp;rsquo;s blog.
I have a keen interest in theories of learning and have completed an NLP Practitioner&amp;rsquo;s courseso the ideas described in the book summary immediately appealed to me.
After coming across the concept of Reading Deliberately in Chapter 6 of the book I decided I should give the SQ3Qapproach to reading books its first run out.</description>

      <description>During the discussionabout Domain Driven Design at the Alt.NETconference I felt like the idea of the Rich Domain Model was being represented as the only way to design software but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel that this is the case.
As always in software we never have a silver bulletand there are times when Domain Model is not necessarily the best choice, just as there are times when OOP is not necessarily the best choice.</description>
