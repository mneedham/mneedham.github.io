      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with Clojure a bit today in preparation for a talk I&amp;#8217;m giving next week and found myself writing the following code to apply the same function to three different scores:
 (defn log2 [n] (/ (Math/log n) (Math/log 2))) (defn score-item [n] (if (= n 0) 0 (log2 n))) (+ (score-item 12) (score-item 13) (score-item 5)) 9.60733031374961   I&amp;#8217;d forgotten about folding over a collection but quickly remembered that I could achieve the same result with the following code:</description>

      <description>One of the points that I emphasised during my talk on building Neo4j backed applications using Clojure last week is understanding when to use Cypher to solve a problem and when to use the programming language.
 A good example of this is in the meetup application I&amp;#8217;ve been working on. I have a collection of events and want to display past events in descending order and future events in ascending order.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite features of Clojure is that it allows you to destructure a data structure into values that are a bit easier to work with.
 I often find myself referring to Jay Fields&#39; article which contains several examples showing the syntax and is a good starting point.
 One recent use of destructuring I had was where I was working with a vector containing events like this:</description>

      <description>I spent much longer than I should have done trying to work out how to create a directory in Clojure as part of an import script I&amp;#8217;m working out so for my future self this is how you do it:
 (.mkdir (java.io.File. &#34;/path/to/dir/to/create&#34;))   I&amp;#8217;m creating a directory which contains today&amp;#8217;s date so I&amp;#8217;d want something like &#39;members-2014-05-24&#39; if I was running it today. The clj-time library is very good for working with dates.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with the meetup API to do some analysis on the Neo4j London meetup and one thing I wanted to do was download all the members of the group.
 A feature of the meetup API is that each end point will only allow you to return a maximum of 200 records so I needed to make use of offsets and paging to retrieve everybody.
 It seemed like a good chance to use some lazy sequences to keep track of the offsets and then stop making calls to the API once I wasn&amp;#8217;t retrieving any more results.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using the clj-time library recently - a Clojure wrapper around Joda Time - and one thing I wanted to do is format a date with day suffixes e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd.
 I started with the following timestamp:
 1309368600000   The first step was to convert that into a DateTime object like so:
 user&amp;gt; (require &#39;[clj-time.coerce :as c]) user&amp;gt; (c/from-long 1309368600000) #&amp;lt;DateTime 2011-06-29T17:30:00.000Z&amp;gt;   I wanted to output that date in the following format:</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing with Clojure over the weekend and got caught out by the behaviour of lazy sequences due to chunking - something which was obvious to experienced Clojurians although not me.
 I had something similar to the following bit of code which I expected to only evaluate the first item of the infinite sequence that the range function generates:

      <description>A few weeks ago I wrote about ranking Champions League teams using the Elo Rating algorithm, and since I wrote that post I&amp;#8217;ve collated data for 10 years worth of matches so I thought an update was in order.
 After extracting the details of all those matches I saved them to a JSON file so that I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have to parse the HTML pages every time I tweaked the algorithm.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in an earlier post I&amp;#8217;ve been transforming Clojure hash&amp;#8217;s into JSON strings using data.json but ran into trouble while trying to parse a hash which contained a Joda Time DateTime instance.
 The date in question was constructed like this:
 (ns json-date-example (:require [clj-time.format :as f]) (:require [clojure.data.json :as json])) (defn as-date [date-field] (f/parse (f/formatter &#34;dd MMM YYYY&#34;) date-field )) (def my-date (as-date &#34;18 Mar 2012&#34;))   And when I tried to convert a hash containing that object into a string I got the following exception:</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I described how I&amp;#8217;d scraped football matches using Clojure&amp;#8217;s Enlive, and the next step after translating the HTML representation into a Clojure map was to save it as a JSON document.
 I decided to follow a two step process to achieve this:
   Convert hash to JSON string
  Write JSON string to file
   I imagine there&amp;#8217;s probably a way to convert the hash to a stream and pipe that into a file but my JSON document isn&amp;#8217;t very large so I think this way is ok for now.</description>

      <description>In the time I&amp;#8217;ve spent playing around with Clojure one thing I&amp;#8217;ve always got confused by is the error message you get when trying to return a vector using the anonymous function shorthand.
 For example, if we want function which creates a vector with the values 1, 2, and the argument passed into the function we could write the following:
 &amp;gt; ((fn [x] [1 2 x]) 6) [1 2 6]   However, when I tried to convert it to the shorthand &#39;#()&#39; syntax I got the following exception:</description>

      <description>Ever since I started using the Emacs + nrepl combination to play around with Clojure I&amp;#8217;ve been getting fairly non descript error messages whenever I pass the wrong parameters to a function.
 For example if I try to update a non existent key in a form I get a Null Pointer Exception:
 &amp;gt; (update-in {} [:mark] inc) NullPointerException clojure.lang.Numbers.ops (Numbers.java:942)   In this case it&amp;#8217;s clear that the hash doesn&amp;#8217;t have a key &#39;:mark&#39; so the function blows up.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with Clojure using Emacs and nrepl recently and my normal work flow is to write some code in Emacs and then have it evaluated in nrepl by typing Ctrl X + Ctrl E at the end of the function.
 I tried this once recently and got the following exception instead of a successful evaluation:

      <description>When putting together data sets to play around with, one of the more boring tasks is stripping out characters that you&amp;#8217;re not interested in and more often than not those characters are white spaces.
 Since I&amp;#8217;ve been building data sets using Clojure I wanted to write a function that would do this for me.
 I started out with the following string:

      <description>When I was implementing the Elo Rating algorithm a few weeks ago one thing I needed to do was come up with a base ranking for each team.
 I started out with a set of teams that looked like this:
 (def teams #{ &#34;Man Utd&#34; &#34;Man City&#34; &#34;Arsenal&#34; &#34;Chelsea&#34;})   and I wanted to transform that into a map from the team to their ranking e.g.
 Man Utd -&amp;gt; {:points 1200} Man City -&amp;gt; {:points 1200} Arsenal -&amp;gt; {:points 1200} Chelsea -&amp;gt; {:points 1200}   I had read the documentation of http://clojuredocs.</description>

      <description>I wanted to do some date manipulation in Clojure recently and figured that since clj-time is a wrapper around Joda Time it&amp;#8217;d probably do the trick.
 The first thing we need to do is add the dependency to our project file and then run lein reps to pull down the appropriate JARs. The project file should look something like this:
 project.clj
 (defproject ranking-algorithms &#34;0.1.0-SNAPSHOT&#34; :license {:name &#34;Eclipse Public License&#34;</description>

      <description>Last year I wrote about a Haskell function called scanl which returned the intermediate steps of a fold over a collection and last week I realised that I needed a similar function in Clojure to analyse a reduce I&amp;#8217;d written.
 A simple reduce which adds together the numbers 1-10 would look like this:
 &amp;gt; (reduce + 0 (range 1 11)) 55   If we want to see the intermediate values of this function called then instead of using http://clojuredocs.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with Clojure maps recently and I wanted to merge two maps of rankings where the rankings in the second map overrode those in the first while only keeping the teams from the first map.
 The http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/merge function overrides keys in earlier maps but also adds keys that only appear in later maps. For example, if we merge the following maps:

 For example if we have the following map of teams to Glicko ratings and ratings deviations:
 (def teams { &#34;Man. United&#34; {:points 1500 :rd 350} &#34;Man. City&#34; {:points 1450 :rd 300} })   We might want to increase Man. United&amp;#8217;s points score by one for which we could use the http://clojuredocs.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in an earlier blog post I&amp;#8217;ve been learning about ranking systems and one of the first ones I came across was the Elo rating system which is most famously used to rank chess players.
 The Elo rating system uses the following formula to work out a player/team&amp;#8217;s ranking after they&amp;#8217;ve participated in a match:
  R&#39; = R + K * (S - E)
   R&#39; is the new rating</description>

      <description>I wanted to play around with some Champions League data and I came across the Rec Sport Soccer Statistics Foundation which has collected results of all matches since the tournament started in 1955.
 I wanted to get a list of all the matches for a specific season so I started out by downloading the file:
 $ pwd /tmp/football $ wget http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec200203det.html   The next step was to load that page and then run a CSS selector over it to extract the matches.</description>

      <title>clojure/Java Interop: The doto macro</title>

      <description>I recently wrote about some code I&amp;#8217;ve been playing with to import neo4j spatial data and while looking to simplify the code I came across the http://clojure.org/java_interop#Java Interop-The Dot special form-(doto instance-expr (instanceMethodName-symbol args*)*) macro.
 The doto macro allows us to chain method calls on an initial object and then returns the resulting object. e.g.
 (doto (new java.util.HashMap) (.put &#34;a&#34; 1) (.put &#34;b&#34; 2)) -&amp;gt; {a=1, b=2}   In our case this comes in quite useful in the function used to create a stadium node which initially reads like this:~ ~lisp (defn create-stadium-node [db line] (let [stadium-node (.</description>

      <description>I wrote a post about a week ago where I described how I&amp;#8217;d added football stadiums to my football graph using neo4j spatial and after I&amp;#8217;d done that I wanted to put it into my import script along with the rest of the data.
 I thought leiningen would probably work quite well for this as you can point it at a Java class and have it be executed.
 To start with I had to change the import code slightly to link stadiums to teams which have already been added to the graph:</description>

      <description>In a post a couple of days ago I described some code I&amp;#8217;d written in R to find out all the features with zero variance in the Kaggle Digit Recognizer data set and yesterday I started working on some code to remove those features.
 Jen and I had previously written some code to parse the training data in Clojure so I thought I&amp;#8217;d try and adapt that to write out a new file without the unwanted pixels.</description>

      <description>In many of the Clojure examples that I&amp;#8217;ve come across the thread last (&amp;#8594;&amp;gt;) macro is used to make it easier (for people from a non lispy background!) to see the transformations that the initial data structure is going through.
 In one of my recent posts I showed how Jen &amp;amp; I had rewritten Mahout&amp;#8217;s entropy function in Clojure:
 (defn calculate-entropy [counts data-size] (-&amp;gt;&amp;gt; counts (remove #{0}) (map (partial individual-entropy data-size)) (reduce +)))   Here we are using the thread last operator to first pass counts as the last argument of the remove function on the next line, then to pass the result of that to the map function on the next line and so on.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been complaining recently to Jen and Bruce about the lack of a beginner&amp;#8217;s guide to emacs paredit mode which seems to be the defacto approach for people working with Clojure and both pointed me to the paredit cheat sheet.
 While it&amp;#8217;s very comprehensive, I found that it&amp;#8217;s a little overwhelming for a complete newbie like myself.
 I therefore thought it&amp;#8217;d be useful to write a bit about a couple of things that I&amp;#8217;ve picked up from pairing with Jen on little bits of Clojure over the last couple of months.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a couple of previous posts Jen and I have been playing around with Mahout random forests and for a few hours last week we spent some time looking through the code to see how it worked.
 In particular we came across an entropy function which is used to determine how good a particular &#39;split&#39; point in a decision tree is going to be.
 I quite like the following definition:</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around a little bit with goose - a HTML content/article extractor - originally in Java but later in clojure where I needed to work out how to include goose and all its dependencies via Leiningen.
 goose isn&amp;#8217;t included in a Maven repository so I needed to create a local repository, something which I&amp;#8217;ve got stuck on in the past.
 Luckily Paul Gross has written a cool blog post explaining how his team got past this problem.</description>

      <description>Most of the work that I&amp;#8217;ve done with Clojure has involved running a bunch of functions directly in the REPL or through Leiningen&amp;#8217;s run target which led to me getting caught out when I created a JAR and tried to run that.
 As I mentioned a few weeks ago I&amp;#8217;ve been rewriting part of our system in Clojure to see how the design would differ and a couple of levels down the Clojure version comprises of applying a map function over a collection of documents.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in an earlier post we&amp;#8217;ve been parsing XML documents with the Clojure zip-filter API and the next thing we needed to do was create a new XML document containing elements which needed to be inside a namespace.
 We wanted to end up with a document which looked something like this:
 &amp;lt;root&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mynamespace:foo xmlns:mynamespace=&#34;http://www.magicalurlfornamespace.com&#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mynamespace:bar&amp;gt;baz&amp;lt;/mynamespace:bar&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/mynamespace:foo&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/root&amp;gt;   We can make use of lazy-xml/emit to output an XML string from some sort of input?</description>

 Nurullah provides a neat zip-str function which we can use to convert an XML string into a zipper object:
 (require &#39;[clojure.zip :as zip] &#39;[clojure.xml :as xml]) (use &#39;[clojure.contrib.zip-filter.xml]) (defn zip-str [s] (zip/xml-zip (xml/parse (java.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with Clojure a bit over the weekend and one thing I got stuck with was working out how to achieve the functionality provided by Scala&amp;#8217;s flatMap or C#&#39;s SelectMany methods on collections.
 I had a collection of zip files and wanted to transform that into a collection of all the file entries in those files.
 If we just use map then we&amp;#8217;ll end up with a collection of collections which is more difficult to deal with going forward.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m up to the chapter on using macros in Stuart Halloway&amp;#8217;s &#39;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356336?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=marneesblo-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1934356336[Programming Clojure]&#39; book and since I&amp;#8217;ve never used a language which has macros in before I thought it&amp;#8217;d be cool to write one.
 In reality there&amp;#8217;s no reason to create a macro to do what I want to do but I wanted to keep the example simple so I could try and understand exactly how macros work.
 I want to create a macro which takes in one argument and then prints hello and the person&amp;#8217;s name.</description>

 (defmacro say-hello [person] println &#34;Hello&#34; person)   This macro doesn&amp;#8217;t even expand like I thought it would:
 user=&amp;gt; (macroexpand-1 &#39;(say-hello blah)) blah   That seemed a bit strange to me but I eventually realised that I&amp;#8217;d missed off the brackets around &#39;println&#39; and the arguments following it which would have resulted in &#39;println&#39; being evaluated with those arguments.</description>

 &#39;when-let&#39; is used when we want to bind an expression to a symbol and only execute the body provided as the second argument to the macro if that symbol evaluates to true.
 As I wrote previously, a value of &#39;false&#39; or &#39;nil&#39; would result in the second argument not being evaluated.
 A simple example of using &#39;when-let&#39; would be:</description>

 We can do the same thing in Clojure but it&amp;#8217;s even better because we can also define and run unit tests which I think is pretty neat.
 Nurullah Akkaya has a good post which describes how to use clojure.test, a testing framework written by Stuart Sierra so I&amp;#8217;ve been using that to define some tests cases for the little RSS feed parser that I&amp;#8217;m writing.</description>

      <description>A function that we had to write in Java on a project that I worked on recently needed to indicate whether there was a gap in a series of data points or not.
 If there were gaps at the beginning or end of the sequence then that was fine but gaps in the middle of the sequence were not.
 null, 1, 2, 3 =&amp;gt; no gaps 1, 2, 3, null =&amp;gt; no gaps 1, null, 2, 3 =&amp;gt; gaps   The Java version looked a bit like this:</description>

 I initially incorrectly thought the &#39;http://clojure.org/api#toc170[contains?]&#39; function was the one that I wanted:
 (contains? &#39;(1 nil 2 3) nil) =&amp;gt; false   I thought it would work the same as the Java equivalent but that function actually checks whether a key exists in a collection rather than a value.</description>

 The meaning of parentheses Much like Keith Bennett I&amp;#8217;m not used to parentheses playing such an important role in the way that an expression gets evaluated.
 As I understand it if an expression is enclosed in parentheses then that means it will be evaluated as a function.
 For example I spent quite a while trying to work out why the following code kept throwing a class cast exception:</description>
