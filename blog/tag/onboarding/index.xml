      <description>For four months during 2012 I was working on the GDS infrastructure team and one of the first tasks that Gareth suggested I do was update a diagram showing how all the different applications and databases worked together.
I thought this was quite a strange thing to ask the &amp;#39;new guy&amp;#39; to do since I obviously knew nothing at all about how anything worked but he told me that was partly why he wanted me to do it.</description>
