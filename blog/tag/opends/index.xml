      <description>A colleague and I have spent the past couple of days spiking solutions for connecting to LDAP servers from Ruby.
 We decided that the easiest way to do this is by using OpenDS, an open source directory service based on LDAP.
 One option we came up with for doing this was to make use of the Java libraries for connecting to the LDAP server and then calling through to these from our Ruby code using the Ruby Java Bridge.</description>
