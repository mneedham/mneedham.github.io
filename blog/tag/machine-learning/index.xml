      <title>Predicting movie genres with node2Vec and Tensorflow</title>

      <description>In my previous post we looked at how to get up and running with the node2Vec algorithm, and in this post we&amp;#8217;ll learn how we can feed graph embeddings into a simple Tensorflow model.
 Recall that node2Vec takes in a list of edges (or relationships) and gives us back an embedding (array of numbers) for each node.
 This time we&amp;#8217;re going to run the algorithm over a movies recommendation dataset from the Neo4j Sandbox.</description>

      <description>In my explorations of graph based machine learning, one algorithm I came across is called node2Vec. The paper describes it as &#34;an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks&#34;.
 So what does the algorithm do? From the website:
  The node2vec framework learns low-dimensional representations for nodes in a graph by optimizing a neighborhood preserving objective. The objective is flexible, and the algorithm accommodates for various definitions of network neighborhoods by simulating biased random walks.</description>

      <description>Over the last week I&amp;#8217;ve been going over various Tensorflow tutorials and one of the best ones when getting started is Sidath Asiri&amp;#8217;s Hello World in TensorFlow, which shows how to build a simple linear classifier on the Iris dataset.
 I&amp;#8217;ll use the same data as Sidath, so if you want to follow along you&amp;#8217;ll need to download these files:
   iris_training.csv
  iris_test.csv
   Loading data The way we load data will remain exactly the same - we&amp;#8217;ll still be reading it into a Pandas dataframe:</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with some Tensorflow tutorials recently and wanted to see if I could create a submission for Kaggle&amp;#8217;s Spooky Author Identification competition that I&amp;#8217;ve written about recently.
 My model is based on one from the text classification tutorial. The tutorial shows how to create custom Estimators which we can learn more about in a post on the Google Developers blog.
 Imports Let&amp;#8217;s get started. First, our imports:</description>

      <title>scikit-learn: Using GridSearch to tune the hyper-parameters of VotingClassifier</title>

      <description>In my last blog post I showed how to create a multi class classification ensemble using scikit-learn&amp;#8217;s http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#voting-classifier and finished mentioning that I didn&amp;#8217;t know which classifiers should be part of the ensemble.
 We need to get a better score with each of the classifiers in the ensemble otherwise they can be excluded.
 We have a TF/IDF based classifier as well as well as the classifiers I wrote about in the last post.</description>

      <title>scikit-learn: Building a multi class classification ensemble</title>

      <description>For the Kaggle Spooky Author Identification I wanted to combine multiple classifiers together into an ensemble and found the VotingClassifier that does exactly that.
 We need to predict the probability that a sentence is written by one of three authors so the VotingClassifier needs to make a &#39;soft&#39; prediction. If we only needed to know the most likely author we could have it make a &#39;hard&#39; prediction instead.
 We start with three classifiers which generate different n-gram based features.</description>
