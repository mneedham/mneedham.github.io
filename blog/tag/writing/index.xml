      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been journalling for almost 2 years now but some days I get stuck and can&amp;#8217;t think of anything to write about.
 I did a bit of searching to see if anybody had advice on solving this problem and found a few different articles:
   The Productive Benefits of Journaling (plus 11 ideas for making the habit stick)
  Read This If You Want To Keep A Journal But Don&amp;#8217;t Know How</description>

      <description>I first came across William Zinsser&amp;#8217;s &#39;http://www.amazon.co.uk/On-Writing-Well-Classic-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1380578447&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=on+writing+well[On Writing Well]&#39; about a year ago, but put it down having flicked through a couple of the chapters that I felt were relevant.
 It came back onto my radar a month ago and this time I decided to read it cover to cover as I was sure there were some insights that I&amp;#8217;d missed due to my haphazard approach the first time around.</description>
