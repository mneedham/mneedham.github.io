      <description>I&#39;ve been journalling for almost 2 years now but some days I get stuck and can&#39;t think of anything to write about.

      <description>I first came across William Zinsser&#39;s &#39;On Writing Well&#39; about a year ago, but put it down having flicked through a couple of the chapters that I felt were relevant.
It came back onto my radar a month ago and this time I decided to read it cover to cover as I was sure there were some insights that I&#39;d missed due to my haphazard approach the first time around.</description>
