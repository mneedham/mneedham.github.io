      <description>We’re using varnish to cache all the requests that come through our web servers and especially in our pre-production environments we deploy quite frequently and want to see the changes that we’ve made.
This means that we need to purge the pages we’re accessing from varnish so that it will actually pass the request through to the application server and serve up the latest version of the page.
For some reason my google-fu when trying to remember/work out how to do this has always been weak but my colleague Shodhan helped me understand how to do this today so I thought I better record it so I don’t forget!</description>
