      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re using varnish to cache all the requests that come through our web servers and especially in our pre-production environments we deploy quite frequently and want to see the changes that we&amp;rsquo;ve made.
This means that we need to purge the pages we&amp;rsquo;re accessing from varnish so that it will actually pass the request through to the application server and serve up the latest version of the page.
For some reason my google-fu when trying to remember/work out how to do this has always been weak but my colleague Shodhan helped me understand how to do this today so I thought I better record it so I don&amp;rsquo;t forget!</description>
