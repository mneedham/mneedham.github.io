      <description>I wanted to make a change to add flatMapto Optionin totallylazyso I had to clone the repositoryand make the change.
I thought I&amp;rsquo;d then be able to just push the change using my Google user name and password but instead ended up with the following error:
âžœ mhneedham-totally-lazy hg push pushing to https://m.h.needham@code.google.com/r/mhneedham-totally-lazy/ searching for changes 1 changesets found http authorization required realm: Google Code hg Repository user: m.h.needham password: abort: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden It turns out that you need to specifically set an option to use your Google account from the settings page:</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been using Mercuriallocally on the project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on and Philshowed me a cool feature called &amp;lsquo;bisect&amp;rsquo; a couple of weeks ago which can be helpful for working out which revision we managed to break our code in.
It&amp;rsquo;s been ported across from Gitand is included in Mercurial from version 1.0.0 rather than just being an extension.
From the bisect extension page:
The usage has changed a bit now that it&amp;rsquo;s included as part of the initial download.</description>
