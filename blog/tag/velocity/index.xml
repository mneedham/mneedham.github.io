      <description>I’ve worked on a few different agile projects and one of the things that hasn’t been completely consistent is when we consider a story to be &amp;#39;done&amp;#39;.
There seem to a few different approaches, each of which has its benefits and drawbacks.
Why do we care? We care about &amp;#39;done&amp;#39; for tracking the points we have achieved in an iteration and for knowing when we have added the value the story provides.</description>
