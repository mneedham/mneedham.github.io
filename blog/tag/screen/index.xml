      <description>Last week I had a ~10GB file I wanted to download to my machine but Chrome’s initial estimate was that it would take 10+ hours to do so which meant I’d have probably shutdown my machine before it had completed.
It seemed to make more sense to spin up an EC2 instance and download it onto there instead but I didn’t want to have to keep an SSH session open to that machine either.</description>
