      <description>Last week I had a ~10GB file I wanted to download to my machine but Chrome&#39;s initial estimate was that it would take 10+ hours to do so which meant I&#39;d have probably shutdown my machine before it had completed.
It seemed to make more sense to spin up an EC2 instance and download it onto there instead but I didn&#39;t want to have to keep an SSH session open to that machine either.</description>
