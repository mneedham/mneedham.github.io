      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been spending quite a bit of time setting up NCover and then integrating it into Team City.
 I&amp;#8217;ve read some posts which cover parts of this process but nothing which covers the end to end process so hopefully my experience can help to fill that void.
 Step 1 Download NCover 1.5.8, NCover Explorer 1.4.0.7, NCover Explorer Extras 1.4.0.5 from Kiwidude&amp;#8217;s website and the NCover website .
   Step 2 Put the following into your Nant build file:</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve been using TeamCity on my current project and it&amp;#8217;s proven to be fairly impressive in general.
 We&amp;#8217;re running quite a few different builds which have dependencies on each other and it&amp;#8217;s been pretty much one click on the web admin tool to get that set up.
 One thing that had me really confused is the default location it chooses to build from. The problem is that it seems to change arbitrarily, with the folder name it builds in being calculated from a VSC hash (not sure quite how that&amp;#8217;s worked out but there we go).</description>
