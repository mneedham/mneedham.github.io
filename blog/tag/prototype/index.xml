      <description>Projects often reach the interesting point where the prototyping and development phases intersect and there are some interesting decisions to make.
From a development point of view the biggest decision is what to do with the code that has been developed.
When developing prototypesthe focus tends to be on getting something to work quick and dirty. Not a lot of time is put into considering edge cases or error conditions or any of the other niceties that are needed for software to be usable in an enterprise environment.</description>
