      <description>I went to see Object Mentor&amp;#8217;s Dave Thomas give a talk about cloud computing on Tuesday evening in a combined meeting of the Sydney Alt.NET user group and several others.
 I&amp;#8217;d not seen him speak before but several colleagues had seen him at JAOO earlier this year so he came highly recommended.
 We started off with a plug for the JAOO Australia 2009 conference which will again be in Brisbane and Sydney at the beginning of May.</description>
