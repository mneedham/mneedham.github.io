      <description>Towards the end of my colleague Julio Maiaâ€™s blog post about the impersonator pattern he suggests that the standalone environment that we can create through the use of impersonators can be quite useful for showcases and we actually had a recent occasion where we had to switch mid-showcase from using the integration environment to make use of an impersonator.
In this case part of the environment went down in the middle of the showcase so if we wanted to keep on going then that was our only option but in general the expectation of the business is that our showcases show them the functionality of the application end to end.</description>
