      <description>I first heard of Uncle Bob a couple of years ago in a conversation with Obie Fernandezand having previously read his Agile Principles, Patterns and Practices in C#book, when my colleague Alexandre Martinscame back from JAOO Sydneyraving about a talk on &amp;lsquo;Clean Code&amp;rsquo; he&amp;rsquo;d seen I knew I had to buy this book when it came out.
In a good trend which I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed in a lot of Martin Fowler books, Uncle Bob lays out in the opening chapter how he thinks the book can best be read.</description>
