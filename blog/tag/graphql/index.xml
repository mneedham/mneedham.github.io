      <description>At Neo4j we distribute several of our Developer Relations projects via GitHub Releases so I was curious whether there was a way to see how many people had downloaded them.
 I found an article explaining how to do it on v3 of the GitHub API, but I&amp;#8217;ve got used to the v4 GraphQL API and I&amp;#8217;m not going back! Thankfully it&amp;#8217;s not too difficult to figure out.

      <description>Last weekend my colleagues Will, Michael, Oskar, and I went to Berlin to spend Sunday at the GraphQL Europe conference in Berlin.
   Neo4j sponsored the conference as we&amp;#8217;ve been experimenting with building a GraphQL to Neo4j integration and wanted to get some feedback from the community as well as learn what&amp;#8217;s going on in GraphQL land.
 Will and Michael have written about their experience where they talk more about the hackathon we hosted so I&amp;#8217;ll cover it more from a personal perspective.</description>
