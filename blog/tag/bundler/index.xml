      <description>Brian, Tejas and I (well mainly them) have been working on an application to give badges to people based on their GitHub activity at the Yahoo Open Hack Day in Bangalore and we’ve been making use of Bundler to pull in our dependencies.
Our Gemfile was originally like this:
gem &amp;#34;sinatra&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34; gem &amp;#34;haml&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;3.0.13&amp;#34; gem &amp;#34;activesupport&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;3.0.0.beta4&amp;#34;, :require =&amp;gt; false gem &amp;#34;tzinfo&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;0.3.22&amp;#34; gem &amp;#34;nokogiri&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;1.4.2&amp;#34; ... For quite a while we were wondering why &amp;#39;bundle install&amp;#39; wasn’t actually resolving anything at all before we RTFM and realised that we needed to call &amp;#39;source&amp;#39; at the top so that bundler knows where to pull the dependencies from.</description>
