      <description>Brian, Tejas and I (well mainly them) have been working on an application to give badges to people based on their GitHub activity at the Yahoo Open Hack Day in Bangalore and we&amp;#8217;ve been making use of Bundler to pull in our dependencies.
 Our Gemfile was originally like this:
 gem &#34;sinatra&#34;, &#34;1.0&#34; gem &#34;haml&#34;, &#34;3.0.13&#34; gem &#34;activesupport&#34;, &#34;3.0.0.beta4&#34;, :require =&amp;gt; false gem &#34;tzinfo&#34;, &#34;0.3.22&#34; gem &#34;nokogiri&#34;, &#34;1.4.2&#34; ...   For quite a while we were wondering why &#39;bundle install&#39; wasn&amp;#8217;t actually resolving anything at all before we RTFM and realised that we needed to call &#39;source&#39; at the top so that bundler knows where to pull the dependencies from.</description>
