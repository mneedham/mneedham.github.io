      <description>A problem that I’m currently trying to solve is how to work out whether a given sentence is a question. If there’s a question mark on the end we can assume it is a question, but what about if the question mark’s been left off?
Few-shot prompting is a technique where we provide some examples in our prompt to try to guide the LLM to do what we want. And, this seemed like a good opportunity to try it out on Meta’s Llama2 7B Large Language Model using Ollama.</description>
