      <description>The way we have setup the build on our continuous integration server, Team City is configured to create a new tag every time the functional tests past successful on that machine.
We then have a QA and Showcase build that we can run to deploy all the artifacts necessary to launch the application on that machine.
Originally I had just written the batch script to take in the tag of the build which the user could find by looking through repo-browser for the last tag created.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s becoming quite a couple of weeks of learning for me around DOS and I have another tip that I just learnt today.
I always found it really frustrating when using the windows command prompt that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get Unix style tab auto completion. To navigate my way to a directory I would do the following:   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ~~~  C:&amp;gt;cd Downloads  C:\Downloads&amp;gt;cd nant-0.</description>

      <description>I mentioned in a couple of earlier posts that I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing quite a bit of work with batch files and the windows command line, and today I wanted to do an If Else statement in one of my scripts.
I thought it would be relatively simple, but after various searches and having read articles that suggested that there wasn&amp;rsquo;t an ELSE construct in batch land I finally found a forum post which explained how to do it.</description>

      <description>In the world of batch files I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying for ages to work out how to get the current/present working directory to make the batch script I&amp;rsquo;m working on a bit more flexible.
In Unix it&amp;rsquo;s easy, just call &amp;lsquo;pwd&amp;rsquo; and you have it. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting something that simple in Windows but it is! A call to &amp;lsquo;cd&amp;rsquo; is all that&amp;rsquo;s needed. If you need to set it in a batch script the following line does the trick:    ~~~  set WORKING_DIRECTORY=%cd%~~~    I was surprised that something so simple (I do now feel like an idiot) wasn&amp;rsquo;t easier to find on Google.</description>
