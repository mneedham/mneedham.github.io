      <description>Through my continued use of buildr on my current project one thing we wanted to do last week was to run our production code tests using some code from the test-utilities project along with its dependencies.
 I thought this would be the default behaviour but it wasn&amp;#8217;t. Looking at the documentation suggested we could achieve this by calling &#39;compile.dependencies&#39; on the project, but from what I can tell you still need to explicitly state that you want to use the main test utilities code as well.</description>
