      <description>While the test data builderpattern is quite a useful one for simplifying the creation of test data in our tests I think we need to be quite careful when using it that we don&amp;rsquo;t lose the intent of the test that we&amp;rsquo;re writing.
The main advantage that I see with this pattern is that by using it we can provide default values for properties of our objects which aren&amp;rsquo;t important for the bit of functionality that we&amp;rsquo;re currently testing but which need to be provided otherwise the test can&amp;rsquo;t actually be run.</description>
