      <description>While the test data builder pattern is quite a useful one for simplifying the creation of test data in our tests I think we need to be quite careful when using it that we don&amp;#8217;t lose the intent of the test that we&amp;#8217;re writing.
 The main advantage that I see with this pattern is that by using it we can provide default values for properties of our objects which aren&amp;#8217;t important for the bit of functionality that we&amp;#8217;re currently testing but which need to be provided otherwise the test can&amp;#8217;t actually be run.</description>
