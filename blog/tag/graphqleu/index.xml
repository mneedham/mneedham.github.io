      <description>Last weekend my colleagues Will, Michael, Oskar, and I went to Berlin to spend Sunday at the GraphQL Europe conference in Berlin.
   Neo4j sponsored the conference as we&amp;#8217;ve been experimenting with building a GraphQL to Neo4j integration and wanted to get some feedback from the community as well as learn what&amp;#8217;s going on in GraphQL land.
 Will and Michael have written about their experience where they talk more about the hackathon we hosted so I&amp;#8217;ll cover it more from a personal perspective.</description>
