      <description>Yesterday I attended the second day of Strata Conf Londonand these are the some of the things I learned from the talks I attended:
British Rail were trying to solve a graph problem when people didn&amp;rsquo;t know about graphs and Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s algorithm hadn&amp;rsquo;t been inventedand it was effectively invented on this project but never publicised. John&amp;rsquo;s suggestion here was that we need to share the stuff that we&amp;rsquo;re doing so that people don&amp;rsquo;t re-invent the wheel.</description>
