      <description>Yesterday I attended the second day of Strata Conf London and these are the some of the things I learned from the talks I attended:
 John Graham Cunningham opened the series of keynotes with a talk describing the problems British Rail had in 1955 when trying to calculate the distances between all train stations and comparing them to the problems we have today. British Rail were trying to solve a graph problem when people didn&#39;t know about graphs and Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm hadn&#39;t been invented and it was effectively invented on this project but never publicised.</description>
