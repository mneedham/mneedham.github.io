      <description>Lizand I recently spent some time building a pair stair to show how long ago people had paired with each other and one of the things we had to do was make AJAX requests to get the pairing data for each person and then collate it all to build the stair.
The original attempt to do this looked a bit like this:
var people = [&amp;#34;Marc&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Liz&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Ken&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Duncan&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Uday&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Mark&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Charles&amp;#34;]; var grid = []; $.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with some node.js code to get each of the commits from our git repository but noticed that it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be returning me all the results.
I had the following code:
var exec = require(&amp;#39;child_process&amp;#39;).exec; var gitRepository = &amp;#39;/some/local/path&amp;#39;; exec(&amp;#39;cd &amp;#39; + gitRepository + &amp;#39; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git log --pretty=format:&amp;#34;%H | %ad | %s%d&amp;#34; --date=raw &amp;#39;, function(error, stdout, stderror) { var commits = stdout.split(&amp;#34;\n&amp;#34;); // do some stuff with commits }); We have around 2000 commits in the repository but I was only getting back 1600 of them when I checked the lengthof commits.</description>

      <description>We make use of the Javascript trim()function in our application but didn&amp;rsquo;t realise that it isn&amp;rsquo;t implemented by Internet Explorer until version 9.
This led to the following error on IE8 when we used it:
There&amp;rsquo;s a stackoverflow threadsuggesting some different ways of implementing your own &amp;lsquo;trim()&amp;rsquo; method but since we&amp;rsquo;re using jQuery already we decided to just use the &amp;lsquo;$.trim()&amp;rsquo; function from there.
Therefore:
var cleaned = ourString.trim(); becomes:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with node.js to generate some graphs from our git repository which effectively meant chaining together a bunch of shell commands to give me the repository data in the format I wanted.
I was able to do this by making use of child_processwhich comes with the core library.
The first version looked like this:
var exec = require(&amp;#39;child_process&amp;#39;).exec, _ = require(&amp;#34;underscore&amp;#34;); ... function parseCommitsFromRepository(fn) { var gitRepository = &amp;#34;/tmp/core&amp;#34;; var gitPlayArea = &amp;#34;/tmp/&amp;#34; + new Date().</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been continuing to play around with node.jsand I thought it would be interesting to write a little application to poll Twitter every minute and save any new Tweets into a CouchDBdatabase.
I first played around with CouchDB in May last year and initially spent a lot of time trying to work out how to install it before coming across CouchDBXwhich gives you one click installation for Mac OS X.</description>

      <description>I recently came across node.jsvia a blog post by Paul Grossand I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with it a bit over the weekend trying to hook up some code to call through to the Twitter API and then return the tweets on my friend timeline.
node.js gives us event driven I/O using JavaScript running server side on top of Google&amp;rsquo;s V8 JavaScript engine.
Simon Willison has part of a presentation on slidesharewhere he describes the difference between the typical thread per request approach and the event based approach to dealing with web requests using the metaphor of bunnies.</description>

      <description>My colleague John Hume wrote an interesting post about his experience with the &amp;lsquo;const&amp;rsquo; keyword in ActionScriptwhere he describes the problems with trying to capture a loop variable in a closure and then evaluating it later on in the code.
Since ActionScript and JavaScript are both dialects of ECMAscript, this is a problem in JavaScript as well, and is due to the fact that variables in JavaScript have function scope rather than block scopewhich is the case in many other languages.</description>

      <description>I came across an interesting post by John Resig where he describes a &amp;lsquo;makeClass&amp;rsquo; functionthat he uses in his code to create functions which can instantiate objects regardless of whether the user calls that function with or without the new keyword.
The main reason that the new keyword seems to be considered harmful is because we might make assumptions in our function that it will be called with the new keyword which changes the meaning of &amp;lsquo;this&amp;rsquo; inside that function.</description>

      <description>I wrote a couple of weeks ago about using the &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;apply&amp;rsquo; functions in Javascript when passing functions aroundand while working on our IE6 specific codeI realised that I&amp;rsquo;d got them mixed up.
We were writing some code to override one of our functions so that we could call the original function and then do something else after that.
The code was roughly like this:
Foo = { bar : function(duck) { console.</description>

      <description>One thing we&amp;rsquo;ve found on my current project is that despite our best efforts we&amp;rsquo;ve still ended up with some javascript code which we only want to run if the user is using Internet Explorer 6 and the question then becomes how to write that code so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t end up being spread all over the application.
jQuery has some functions which allow you to work out which browser&amp;rsquo;s being used but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that when we use those you tend to end up with if statements dotted all around the code which isn&amp;rsquo;t so good.</description>

      <description>I spent some time over the weekend playing with the bowling game katain Javascript.
I thought I knew the language well enough to be able to do this kata quite easily so I was quite surprised at how much I struggled initially.
These are some of my observations from this exercise:
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I quite get the idea of the &amp;lsquo;describe&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;it&amp;rsquo; blocks which I believe are inspired by Rspec.</description>

      <description>I already wrote about how I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a bit about the &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;apply&amp;rsquo; functions in Javascript this week but as I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the majority of my time doing front end stuff this week I&amp;rsquo;ve also learnt and noticed some other things which I thought were quite interesting.
As a result we needed to know the character codes for the banned characters. While googling to work them out we came across Uncle Jim&amp;rsquo;s CharCode Translatorwhich allows you to type in a character and get its character code and vice versa.</description>

      <description>Having read Douglas Crockford&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Javascript: The Good Parts&amp;rsquo; I was already aware that making use of the &amp;lsquo;this&amp;rsquo; keyword in Javascript is quite dangerous but we came across what must be a fairly common situation this week where we wanted to pass around a function which made use of &amp;lsquo;this&amp;rsquo; internally.
We were writing some JSTestDrivertests around a piece of code which looked roughly like this:
function Common() { this.OtherMethod = function(value) { // do some manipulation on value 	return someMagicalNewValue;	}; this.</description>

      <description>We ran into an interesting problem today when moving some Javascript code which was making use of the &amp;lsquo;string.replace&amp;rsquo; function to strip out the £ sign from some text boxes on a form.
The code we had written was just doing this:
var textboxValue = $(&amp;#34;#fieldId&amp;#34;).val().replace(/£/, &amp;#39;&amp;#39;); So having realised that we had this code all over the place we decided it would make sense to create a common function that strip the pound sign out.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I wrote a post about my software development journeyover the last year and towards the end I described the difficulties we were having in making changes to some C# code while being sure that we hadn&amp;rsquo;t broken javascript functionality that also relied on that code.
We typically have code which looks like this:
public class SomeController { public ActionResult SomeControllerAction() { var someModel = new SomeModel { Property1 = &amp;#34;my Property&amp;#34; }; return new JsonResult { Data = someModel }; } } public class SomeModel { public string Property1 { get; set; } } We would make use of this type of object in javascript code like so:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a bit more work on my twitter applicationover the weekend - this time taking the tweets that I&amp;rsquo;ve stored in CouchDB and displaying them on a web page.
One of the problems I had is that the text of the tweets is just plain text so if there is a link in a tweet then when I display it on a web page it isn&amp;rsquo;t clickable since it isn&amp;rsquo;t enclosed by the &amp;lsquo;&amp;lt;a href&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;rsquo; tag.</description>

      <description>It seems that much like in Java, dates in Javascript are mutable, meaning that it is possible to change a date after it has been created.
We had this painfully shown to us when using the datejslibrary to manipulate some dates.
The erroneous code was similar to this:
var jan312009 = new Date(2008, 1-1, 31); var oneMonthFromJan312009 = new Date(jan312009.add(1).month()); See the subtle error? Outputting these two values gives the following:</description>

For example, say we want to add one month to January 31st 2009. We would expect one month from this date to be February 28th 2009:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working quite a lot with Javascript and in particular jQueryrecently and since I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much in this area before all the tips and tricks are new to me.
One thing which is always useful no matter the programming language is to use it in a way that you can get rapid feedback on what you are doing.
Fortunately there are quite a few tools that allow us to do this with Javascript:</description>
