      <description>I pick up Michael Feathers&amp;rsquo; Working Effectively with Legacy Codebook from time to time and one of my favourite parts of the book is the chapter where he talks about &amp;lsquo;Seams&amp;rsquo;.
To quote the book:
Seams in the book are generally discussed in terms of how we can get tests around legacy code which was written without easy testability in mind but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that the ideas behind seams seem to be more widely applicable than this.</description>
