      <title>My top 10 technology podcasts</title>

      <description>For the last six months I’ve been listening to 2 or 3 technology podcasts every day while out running and on my commute and I thought it’d be cool to share some of my favourites.
I listen to all of these on the Podbean android app which seems pretty good. It can’t read the RSS feeds of some podcasts but other than that it’s worked well.
Anyway, on with the podcasts:</description>

      <description>I’ve previously found it very difficult to read math heavy content which has made it challenging to read Distributed Computing which I bought last May.
After several false starts where I gave up after getting frustrated that I couldn’t understand things the first time around and forgot everything if I left it a couple of days I decided to try again with a different approach.
I’ve been trying a technique I learned from Mini Habits where every day I have a (very small) goal of reading one page of the book.</description>

      <description>I upgraded to IntelliJ 15.0 a few days ago and was initially seeing the following exception when trying to compile:
module-name java: cannot find JDK 1.8 I’ve been compiling against JDK 1.8 for a while now using IntelliJ 14 so I wasn’t sure what was going on.
I checked my project settings and they seemed fine:
The error message suggested I look in the logs to find more information but I wasn’t sure where those live!</description>

      <description>I’ve been trying to put some tests around an Neo4j unmanaged extension I’ve been working on and ran into the following stack trace when launching the server using the Neo4j test harness:

      <description>I’ve become quite interesting in record linkage recently and came across the Duke project which provides some tools to help solve this problem. I thought I’d give it a try.
The typical problem when doing record linkage is that we have two records from different data sets which represent the same entity but don’t have a common key that we can use to merge them together. We therefore need to come up with a heuristic that will allow us to do so.</description>

      <description>I recently finished reading Kelly McGonigal’s excellent book &amp;#39;The Willpower Instinct&amp;#39; having previously watched her Google talk of the same title
My main takeaway from the book is that there are things that we want to do (or not do) but doing them (or not as the case may be) isn’t necessarily instinctive and so we need to develop some strategies to help ourselves out.
In one of the early chapters she suggests picking a habit that you want to do less off and write down on a piece of paper every time you want to do it and how you’re feeling at that point.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I wrote about the learning to cycle dependency graph which described some of the skills required to become proficient at riding a bike.
While we’ve been practicing various skills/sub skills I’ve often found myself saying the following:
if it’s not hard you’re not practicing me, April 2015
i.e. you should find the skill you’re currently practicing difficult otherwise you’re not stretching yourself and therefore aren’t getting better.</description>

      <description>I’ve recently been reading the literature written by K. Anders Eriksson and co on Deliberate Practice and one of the suggestions for increasing our competence at a skill is to put ourselves in a situation where we can fail.
I’ve been reading Think Bayes - an introductory text on Bayesian statistics, something I know nothing about - and each chapter concludes with a set of exercises to practice, a potentially perfect exercise in failure!</description>

      <description>Since I upgraded to Yosemite I’ve noticed that attempts to resolve localhost on my home network have been taking ages (sometimes over a minute) so I thought I’d try and work out why.
This is what my initial /etc/hosts file looked like based on the assumption that my machine’s hostname was teetotal:
$ cat /etc/hosts ## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting.</description>

      <description>I recently read a book in the &amp;#39;getting things done&amp;#39; genre written by Stephen Guise titled &amp;#39;Mini Habits&amp;#39; and although I generally don’t like those types of books I quite enjoyed this one and decided to give his system a try.
The underlying idea is that there are two parts of actually doing stuff:
Planning what to do
Doing it
We often get stuck in between the first and second steps because what we’ve planned to do is too big and overwhelming.</description>

      <description>Earlier in the year I wrote a blog post showing how to build a Mac OS X DMG file for a Java application and I recently revisited this script to update it to a new version and ran into a frustrating error message.
I tried to run the following command to create a new DMG file from a source folder...
$ hdiutil create -volname &amp;#34;DemoBench&amp;#34; -size 100m -srcfolder dmg/ -ov -format UDZO pack.</description>

      <description>About a third of the way through Mastering Data Modeling the authors describe common data modelling mistakes and one in particular resonated with me - &amp;#39;Thin LDS, Lost Users&amp;#39;.
LDS stands for &amp;#39;Logical Data Structure&amp;#39; which is a diagram depicting what kinds of data some person or group wants to remember. In other words, a tool to help derive the conceptual model for our domain.
They describe the problem that a thin model can cause as follows:</description>

      <description>I spent some time earlier in the week trying to import a CSV file extracted from Hadoop into Neo4j using Cypher’s LOAD CSV command and initially struggled due to some rogue characters.
The CSV file looked like this:
$ cat foo.csv foo,bar,baz 1,2,3 I wrote the following LOAD CSV query to extract some of the fields and compare others:
load csv with headers from &amp;#34;file:/Users/markneedham/Downloads/foo.csv&amp;#34; AS line RETURN line.foo, line.</description>

      <description>I’ve been working with Neo4j full time for slightly more than a year now and from interacting with the community I’ve noticed that while using different features of the product people fall into 4 categories.
These are as follows:
On one axis we have &amp;#39;loudness&amp;#39; i.e. how vocal somebody is either on twitter, StackOverflow or by email and on the other we have &amp;#39;success&amp;#39; which is how well a product feature is working for them.</description>

      <description>We have a few internal applications at Neo which can be launched using &amp;#39;java -jar &amp;#39; and I always forget where the jars are so I thought I’d wrap a Mac OS X application bundle around it to make life easier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
My favourite installation pattern is the one where when you double click the dmg it shows you a window where you can drag the application into the &amp;#39;Applications&amp;#39; folder, like this:</description>

      <description>One of the stranger features of Skype is that that it allows you to delete the contents of a message that you’ve already sent to someone - something I haven’t seen on any other messaging system I’ve used.
For example if I wrote a message in Skype and wanted to edit it I would press the &amp;#39;up&amp;#39; arrow:
Once I’ve deleted the message I’d see this in the space where the message used to be:</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago Alistair and I were working on the code used to model the labels that a node has attached to it in a Neo4j database.
The way this works is that chunks of 32 nodes ids are represented as a 32 bit bitmap for each label where a 1 for a bit means that a node has the label and a 0 means that it doesn’t.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I wrote about my experiences supporting production code while working at uSwitch.
Since then I’ve been working on support for Neo4j customers and I’ve realised that there are a couple of other things to keep in mind while debugging production problems that I missed from the initial list.
Keep a clear head / Hold back your assumptions The first is that it’s very helpful to completely clear your head of any assumptions when looking at a problem.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I wrote about the Elo Rating system and when reading more about it I learnt that one of its weaknesses is that it doesn’t take into account the reliability of a players&amp;#39; rating.
For example, a player may not have played for a long time. When they next play a match we shouldn’t assume that the accuracy of that rating is the same as for another player with the same rating but who plays regularly.</description>

The format was changed as well - the evening consisted of ~10 lightening talks which were spread out over about 3 hours, an approach Rik has used at similar events in Belgium and Holland earlier in the year.</description>

      <description>One of the common feature requests on the ThoughtWorks projects that I worked on was that the application we were working on should be almost infinitely configurable to cover potential future use cases.
My experience of attempting to do this was that you ended up with an extremely complicated code base and those future use cases often didn’t come to fruition.
It therefore made more sense to solve the problem at hand and then make the code more configurable if/when the need arose.</description>

$ ping host.that.is.invalid PING host.that.is.invalid (92.242.132.15): 56 data bytes Request timeout for icmp_seq 0 Request timeout for icmp_seq 1 Request timeout for icmp_seq 2 As you can see, that hostname is resolving to &amp;#39;92.</description>

      <title>AWS: Attaching an EBS volume on an EC2 instance and making it available for use</title>

      <description>I recently wanted to attach an EBS volume to an existing EC2 instance that I had running and since it was for a one off tasks (famous last words) I decided to configure it manually.
I created the EBS volume through the AWS console and one thing that initially caught me out is that the EC2 instance and EBS volume need to be in the same region and zone.</description>

      <description>My former colleague Anne Simmons recently wrote an interesting post in which she describes some of the reasons that she finds herself not wanting to write about technical topics..
I wrote a post at the end of 2012 in which I explained some of the reasons why I think writing about what you learn is a good idea but Anne brought up some things I hadn’t thought of which I think are worth addressing.</description>

      <description>Until I started working on the uSwitch energy website around 8 months ago I had not really done any support of a production system so I learnt some interesting lessons in my time there.
Look at the new code first We had our application wired up to Airbrake so whenever a user did anything which resulted in an exception being thrown we received a report with the stack trace, environment variables and which page they were on.</description>

      <description>I previously wrote a blog post describing how I’ve been trying to learn more about network sockets in which I created some server sockets and connected to them using netcat.
The next step was to do the same thing in Java and I started out by writing a server socket which echoed any messages sent by the client:
public class EchoServer { public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { int port = 4444; ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port, 50, InetAddress.</description>

      <description>While reading through some of the neo4j code a few weeks ago I realised that I didn’t have a very good understanding about the mechanics behind network ports/sockets so I thought I’d try to learn more.
In particular I’d not considered what binding a socket to different network interfaces meant so I decided to setup a few examples using netcat to help me understand better.
To start with let’s list the network interfaces that I have on my machine using ifconfig:</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago I came across an interesting article by the author of &amp;#39;You Are Not So Smart&amp;#39; about a fallacy known as &amp;#39;Survivorship Bias&amp;#39; which Wikipedia defines as:
The logical error of concentrating on the people or things that &amp;#34;survived&amp;#34; some process and inadvertently overlooking those that didn’t because of their lack of visibility.
I particularly liked the story describing how Abraham Wald helped the US military overcome an instance of this error when trying to work out where to place armour on their bomber planes:</description>

      <description>In my continued reading of Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow I’ve reached the section which talks about the affect heuristic which seems particularly applicable to the technical decisions that we make.
The dominance of conclusions over arguments is most pronounced where emotions are involved. The psychologist Paul Slovic has proposed an affect heuristic in which people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world.
The way I’ve seen this heuristic coming into play in the software world is when we do an &amp;#39;objective&amp;#39; overview of the technical tools/options that we could use to solve a particular problem.</description>

      <description>On the recommendation of Mike Jones I’ve been reading through Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow in which the first part of the book covers our two styles of thinking:
System 1 - operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.
System 2 - allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.</description>

      <description>Over the past few years I’ve seen the emergence of polyglot persistence i.e. using different data storage technologies for different data and in most situations we work that out up front.
For example we might use MongoDB to store data about a customer journey through our website but we might simultaneously write page view data through to something like Hadoop or Redshift:
This works reasonably well but sometimes it might not be immediately obvious how we want to query our data when we first start collecting it and our storage choice might not be the best for writing these queries.</description>

      <description>I was chatting with Brian Blignaut last week after the Equal Experts NoSQL event and he made an interesting observation that in this age of Polyglot Persistence we often rule out the relational database.
I think it’s definitely better that we now have many different options for where we store our data - be it as key/value pairs, documents or as a network/graph.
Having these options forces us to think more about how we’re going to read/write data in our application whereas previously our effort was focused around which tables we were going to pull out.</description>

Alfred Alfred is a Quick Silver replacement which allows you to quickly open applications, find files, search Google and more. Even though we’re not using half of its features it’s still proved to be useful.</description>

      <description>After coming across this post about why you should use Sublime Text I decided to try using it a bit more and one of the things that I missed from Textmate was the way you can select the current file on the sidebar.
In Textmate the shortcut to do that is &amp;#39;Cmd + Ctrl + R&amp;#39; so I wanted to be able to do something similar or configure Sublime so it responded to the same shortcut.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago Tim and I were spinning up a new service on a machine which wasn’t quite working so we were manually making changes to the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file and restarting nginx to try and sort it out.
This process is generally not that interesting - you open the file in vi, make some changes, close it, then restart nginx and see if it works. If not then you open the file again and repeat.</description>

      <description>Jason and I were setting up an internal static website using an S3 bucket a couple of days ago and wanted to point a more friendly domain name at it.
We initially called our bucket &amp;#39;static-site&amp;#39; and then created a CNAME entry using zerigo to point our sub domain at the bucket.
The mapping was something like this:
our-subdomain.somedomain.com -&amp;gt; static-site.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com When we tried to access the site through our-subdomain.</description>

Since this particular service only serves HTTP GET requests it was reasonably easy to setup a cURL command to do this:
while true; do curl -k -s -w %{time_total} https://serviceurl/whatever/something; -o /dev/null; printf &amp;#34;\n&amp;#34;; done &amp;gt; service.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I wrote a bunch of posts exploring my experiences of outside in development eventually coming to the conclusion that it seemed to make sense to drive out functionality from the UI and work back from there.
i.e. we take a vertical slice of functionality and then drive it end to end.
On the team I’m working on there’s been success using an approach where the functionality is still split vertically but we work across a horizontal layer for all the cards before moving onto the next layer.</description>

He referred to this as having &amp;#39;compatible opinions on software&amp;#39; and since I read the post I’ve become much more aware of this myself on the teams that I’ve worked on.</description>

The approaches tend to fall into roughly three categories:
Predominantly Manual This tends to be less frequent these days as most developers have at some stage flicked through The Pragmatic Programmer and been persuaded that automating away boring and repetitive tasks is probably a good idea.</description>

About 4 1/2 years ago Jay Fields wrote a blog post where he encouraged people to write, present and contribute and outlined the advantages he’d seen in his career from doing so.
In hindsight the bit which stood out the most for me was the following paragraph:
Don’t know what to write about? The answers are all around you. Anything you do that’s interesting, there’s 100 people searching Google for how to do it.</description>

      <description>Something that I’ve noticed when trying to install various different bundles is that the installation instructions which worked flawlessly on Snow Leopard don’t seem to do the job on Mountain Lion.
For example, the Clojure bundle assumes that the installation directory is &amp;#39;~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles&amp;#39; but for some reason the &amp;#39;Bundles&amp;#39; folder doesn’t exist.
We therefore have two choices:
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles and then continue as normal
Install our bundle into &amp;#39;/Applications/TextMate.</description>

      <description>I wanted to try running some of the machine learning algorithms that Jen and I have been playing around with on a beefier machine so I thought spinning up an AWS instance would be the best way to do that.
I built the JAR with the appropriate algorithms on my machine and then wanted to copy it up onto an AWS instance.
I could have used scp but I quite like the progress bar that you can get with rsync and since the JAR had somehow drifted to a size of 47MB the progress bar was useful.</description>

      <description>We were trying to run a puppet update on some machines last week and one of the first things it does is run &amp;#39;apt-get update&amp;#39; which was working on all but one node for which it was returning the following exception:
Err http://us-west-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ i386 Packages 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable Fetched 5,079B in 2s (2,296B/s) W: Failed to fetch http://us-west-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/maverick-updates/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable It turns out one way that exception can manifest is if you’ve got a partial copy of the index files from the repository and in this case the solution was as simple as deleting those and trying again:</description>

      <description>A common approach we’ve been taking on some of the applications I’ve worked on recently is to decompose the system we’re building into smaller micro services which are independently deployable and communicate with each other over HTTP.
An advantage of decomposing systems like that is that we could have separate teams working on each service and then make use of a consumer driven contract as a way of ensuring the contract between them is correct.</description>

      <description>In my continued attempts at the Kaggle Digit Recognizer problem I’ve been playing around with the encog library to try and build a neural networks solution to the problem.
Unfortunately it’s not quite working at the moment so I wanted to debug the code and see whether the input parameters were being correctly translated from the CSV file.
Each input is an array containing 784 values but by default IntelliJ restricts you to seeing 100 elements which wasn’t helpful in my case since the early values tend to all be 0 and it’s not until you get half way through that you see different values:</description>

      <description>For at least the last few years I’ve heard colleagues talk about working out the core competency of our clients businesses and I’d confused myself into thinking that the software we helped them build was the core competency.
I think Martin Fowler best explains how technology and business core competences work in his post about utility and strategic projects where he describes the difference between these like so:
So what is the distinguishing factor between utility and strategic projects?</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my previous post we’ve been making it possible to deploy our application to a new environment and as part of this we defined an upstart script which would run the JAR.
We tend to edit code on Windows and then test it out on the vagrant VM afterwards.
The end of our upstart script looked a bit like this:
script cd /opt/app java -jar /opt/app/app.jar /opt/app/config.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a really interesting post about black box abstraction by Angeleah where she talks about developers desire to know how things work and the need to understand when and when not to follow that instinct.
Angeleah defines black box abstraction like so:
It is a technique for controlling complexity and abstracting detail. The point of doing this is to allow you to to build bigger things. Hopefully bigger boxes.</description>

      <description>Over the past couple of years I’ve worked on several different applications and one thing they had in common was that they had a huge feature which would take a few months to complete and initially seemed difficult to break down.
Since we favoured an incremental/iterative approach to building these features and wanted to add value in short feedback cycles we needed to find a way to break them down.</description>

      <description>My colleague Erik Doernenburg has written a couple of articles recently discussing the reasons why people buy and build IT solutions and one part in particular resonated with me:
it is also possible, and not uncommon, that the software package does not do exactly what the business needs, leading to decreased productivity and lost opportunities.
I feel like there’s a mindset change once you start thinking which package you could buy to solve your problem whereby you stop solving the problem you actually have and focus instead on what features the package offers.</description>

      <description>One of the most unexpected things that I picked up while pairing with Ashok for a few days in August/September is his ability to pick the simplest solution when confronted with a problem.
On numerous occasions we’d be trying to do something and I’d end up on a yak shaving mission trying to get a complicated approach to work while he watched on with bemusement.
I thought I’d actually learnt this lesson from working with Ashok but on a couple of occasions over the last week I’ve caught myself doing the same thing again!</description>

I’ve got a simple controller which looks like this:

      <description>We’re using varnish to cache all the requests that come through our web servers and especially in our pre-production environments we deploy quite frequently and want to see the changes that we’ve made.
This means that we need to purge the pages we’re accessing from varnish so that it will actually pass the request through to the application server and serve up the latest version of the page.
For some reason my google-fu when trying to remember/work out how to do this has always been weak but my colleague Shodhan helped me understand how to do this today so I thought I better record it so I don’t forget!</description>

Acquire::http::Proxy &amp;#34;http://apt-cache-server:3142&amp;#34; And when we ran &amp;#39;apt-get update&amp;#39; we were getting the following error:

By coincidence we started saving each row into a hash map and were then able to see what was going wrong:</description>

Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has &amp;#34;cursed&amp;#34; us. And it becomes difficult for us to share out knowledge with others, because can’t readily re-create our listeners&amp;#39; state of mind.</description>

      <description>I started playing around with the TFL Bus stop location and routes API and one of the annoying things about the data is that it uses easting/northing values to describe the location of bus stops rather than lat/longs.
The first few lines of the CSV file look like this:
1000,91532,490000266G,WESTMINSTER STN &amp;lt;&amp;gt; / PARLIAMENT SQUARE,530171,179738,177,0K08,0 10001,72689,490013793E,TREVOR CLOSE,515781,174783,78,NB16,0 10002,48461,490000108F,HIGHBURY CORNER,531614,184603,5,C902,0 For each of the stops I wanted to convert from the easting/northing value to the equivalent lat/long value but I couldn’t find a simple way of doing it in code although I did come across an API that would do it for me.</description>

      <description>For the last 5 weeks or so I’ve been working with puppet every day to automate the configuration of various nodes in our stack and my most interesting observation so far is that you really need to keep your discipline when doing this type of work.
We can keep that discipline in three main ways when developing modules.
Running from scratch Configuring various bits of software seems to follow the 80/20 rule and we get very close to having each thing working quite quickly but then end up spending a disproportionate amount of time tweaking the last little bits.</description>

Unfortunately we couldn’t find any instructions on github explaining how to set them up but after a bit of trial and error we figured it out.
One of the modules that we wanted to use was diskstat which provides I/O wait time metrics which we couldn’t find in the built in modules.</description>

      <description>On the project I’m currently working on we’re doing quite a bit of puppet and although we’re using the puppet master approach in production &amp;amp; test environments it’s still useful to be able to run puppet headless to test changes locally.
Since several of the commands require having write access to &amp;#39;root&amp;#39; folders we need to run &amp;#39;puppet apply&amp;#39; as a super user using sudo. We also need to run it in the context of some environment variables which the root user has.</description>

It’s reasonably easy to insert movies into Powerpoint but I was finding that when I saved the file and then reloaded it the movies had been converted into images which wasn’t what I wanted at all!
Eventually I came across a blog post which explained that I’d been saving the file as the wrong format.</description>

      <description>I think one of the first things that I learnt about dealing with users in a data store is that you should never use name as a primary key because their might be two people with the same name.
Despite knowing that I foolishly chose to ignore this knowledge when building my neo4j graph and used name as the key for the Lucene index.
I thought I’d got away with it but NO!</description>

      <description>We’re using the Brightbox Ruby repository to get the versions of Ruby which we install on our machines and although we eventually put the configuration for this repository into Puppet we initially tested it out on a local VM.
To start with you need to add the repository to /etc/apt/sources.list:
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/brightbox/ruby-ng/ubuntu lucid main To get that picked up we run the following:
apt-get update Which initially threw this error because it’s a gpg signed repository and we hadn’t added the key:</description>

      <description>On the project I’m currently working on we have our development environment setup on a bare bones Ubuntu instance which we run via VmWare.
We wanted to be able to edit files on the VM from the host O/S so my colleague Phil suggested that we set up a Samba server on the VM and then connect to it from the Mac.
We first needed to install a couple of packages on the VM:</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I asked the twittersphere for some advice on how I could get better at writing recursive functions and one of the pieces of advice was to work through The Little Schemer.
I first heard about The Little Schemer a couple of years ago and after going through the first few pages I got bored and gave up.
I still found the first few pages a bit trivial this time around as well but my colleague Jen Smith encouraged me to keep going and once I’d got about 20 pages in it became clearer to me why the first few pages had been written the way they had.</description>

      <description>On the project I’ve been working on we’re building an API to be used by other applications in the organisation but when we started none of those applications were ready to integrate with us and therefore drive the API design.
Initially we tried driving the API through integration style tests but we realised that taking this approach made it quite difficult for us to imagine how an application would use it.</description>

      <description>A couple of years ago I wrote a post describing an approach my then colleague Christian Blunden used to help improve the performance of an application where you try to do expensive things less or find another way to do them.
On the application I’m currently working on we load reference data from an Oracle database into memory based on configurations provided by the user.
There are multiple configurations and then multiple ways that those configurations can be priced so we have two nested for loops in which we load data and then perform calculations on it.</description>

      <description>One of the most common instincts of a developer when starting on a new team is to look at the way the application has been designed and find ways that it can be done differently.
Most often &amp;#39;differently&amp;#39; means that a pattern used in a previous project will be favoured and while I think it’s good to make use of experience that we’ve gained, we do miss out on some learning if we write every application the same way.</description>

      <description>Everyone now and then we end up having to write a bunch of mapping code and I quite like using IntelliJ’s &amp;#39;Replace&amp;#39; option to do it but always end up spending about 5 minutes trying to remember how to do capture groups so I thought I’d write it down this time.
Given the following text in our file:
val mark = 0 val dave = 0 val john = 0 val alex = 0 Let’s say we wanted to prefix each of those names with &amp;#39;cool&amp;#39; and had decided not to use Column mode for whatever reason.</description>

      <description>I recently read the Graphite chapter of The Architecture of Open Source Applications book which mostly tells the story of how Chris Davis incrementally built out Graphite - a pretty cool tool that can be used to do real time graphing of metrics.
The whole chapter is a very good read but I found the design reflections especially interesting:
One of Graphite’s greatest strengths and greatest weaknesses is the fact that very little of it was actually &amp;#34;designed&amp;#34; in the traditional sense.</description>

      <description>We wanted to be able to retain the value of a drop down menu that was being dynamically populated (via an AJAX call) when the user hit the back button but the AJAX request re-runs when we go hit back therefore losing our selection.
Our initial thinking was that we might be able to store the value of the dropdown in a hidden field and then restore it into the dropdown using jQuery on page load but that approach didn’t work since hidden fields don’t seem to retain their values when you hit back.</description>

      <description>One of the things that I’ve learnt while developing code in an incremental way is that the way the code should be designed isn’t going to be obvious straight away so we need to be patience and wait for it to emerge.
There’s often a tendency to pull out classes or methods but more recently I’ve been trying to follow an approach where I leave the code in one class/method and play around with/study it until I see a good abstraction to make.</description>

      <description>On the current application I’m working on we need to make use of some data which comes from another system so we’ve created an import script which creates a copy of that data so that we can use it in our application.
In general we’ve been trying not to do too much manipulation of the data and keeping it close to the initial structure so that if something goes wrong with the import we can more easily trace the problem back to the original data source.</description>

      <description>On the majority of the teams that I’ve worked on there’s been a time where everyone seems to be disagreeing with each other about almost everything and the whole situation becomes pretty tense for all involved.
The first time I came across this it seemed quite dysfunctional but I was introduced to Bruce Tuckman’s model of group development which helps to explain what’s going on.
Tuckman outlines four stages which teams tend to go through - forming, storming, norming and performing.</description>

      <description>My colleague Ola Bini recently wrote a post describing his thoughts on the syntax of programming languages and while the post in general is interesting the bit that most resonates with me at the moment is the following:
Typing fewer characters doesn’t actually optimize for writing either - the intuition behind that statement is quite easy: imagine you had to write a book. However, instead of writing it in English, you just wrote the gzipped version of the book directly.</description>

      <description>I’ve been reading The Progress Principle on and off for the last couple of months and one of my favourite quotes from the book is the following:
Truly effective video game designers know how to create a sense of progress for players within all stages of a game. Truly effective managers know how to do the same for their subordinates.
While a tech lead might not like to be referred to as a manager I think part of the role does involve helping developers to make progress and the best ones I’ve worked with seem to do that instinctively.</description>

      <description>In my latest post I described an approach we’d been taking when analysing how to rewrite part of an existing system so that we could build the new version in an incremental way.
Towards the end I pointed out that we weren’t actually going to be using an incremental approach as we’d initially thought which was due to a couple of constraints that we have to work under.
Hardware provisioning One of the main reasons that we favoured an incremental approach is that we’d be able to deploy to production early which would allow us to show a quicker return on investment.</description>

      <description>During December/early January we spent some time analysing an existing system which we were looking to rewrite and our approach was to look for how we could do this in an incremental way.
In order to do that we needed to look for what Michael Feathers refers to as a seam:
A seam is a place where you can alter behaviour in your program without editing in that place</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a post last week we’ve been automating the setup of our developer machines with puppet over the last week and one thing that we’ve learnt is that you need to be careful about how you define dependencies.
The aim is to get your scripts to the point where the outcome is reasonably deterministic so that we can have confidence they’re going to work the next we run them.</description>

      <description>We’ve been spending some time trying to setup our developer environment on a Oracle Linux 5.7 build and one of the first steps was to install Puppet as we’ve already created scripts which automate the installation of most things.
Unfortunately Oracle Linux builds don’t come with any yum repos configured so when you run the following command…​
ls -alh /etc/yum.repos.d/ …​you don’t see anything :(
We eventually realised that there are a list of public yum repositories on the Oracle website, of which we needed to download the definition for Oracle Linux 5 like so:</description>

      <description>I recently came across Carl Erickson’s &amp;#39;small teams are dramatically more efficient than large teams&amp;#39; blog post which reminded me of something which my colleague Ashok suggested as a useful way for determining team size - the application footprint.
As I understand it the application footprint is applicable for an application at a given point in time and determines how many parallel tasks/streams of work we have.
In the case of the project that I’m currently working on there are 3 separate components which need to interact with each other via an API but otherwise are independent.</description>

I had to connect to exp like this:
exp user/password@remote_address And then filled in the other parameters interactively.
Unfortunately when I tried to actually export the specified tables I got the following error message:

Am I actually learning anything? A thought I had many times in 2011 was &amp;#39;am I actually learning anything?&amp;#39; as, although I was working with languages that I hadn’t used professionally before, the applications that we I worked on were very similar to ones that I’ve worked on previously.</description>

      <description>On a reasonable number of the systems that I’ve worked on over the past few years there’s been a &amp;#39;black box&amp;#39; component which the team I’ve been on has needed to integrate with.
I’ve always found it a little strange that you wouldn’t need to/want to know how that part of the system worked or that you could actually believe that it was truly a black box.
If it doesn’t work then you have no way of diagnosing the problem - did you do something wrong, was there something wrong inside the black box or was it something else.</description>

Since the user needs to be able to search for documents by the userFacingId we reference it by that identifier in the database and the web application.
Each document also has an external identifier and we use this to identify the PDFs on the file system.</description>

      <description>On my current project we have a wall where we keep track of &amp;#39;window fixing&amp;#39; tasks - things that people want to fix in the code base but chose to defer until a later date.
Every now and then we take what’s on the wall and prioritise it according to Fabio Pereira’s effort/pain matrix so that we know which clean up tasks will provide the greatest value to the team.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my previous post I’ve been writing a little application to create graphs based on our git repository history and in one of them we wanted to try and create a graph showing which people had been working on which stories.
I needed a way to extract a story number from the git commit message and then store them all in a text file.
A typical commit with a story number in might look like this:</description>

      <description>I’ve been working my way slowly through the O’Reilly &amp;#39;Mastering Regular Expressions&amp;#39; book and recently read about the non capturing match operator which came in useful for some Git log parsing I’ve been doing.
On the project I’m working on we all commit as the same user and then put our names at the beginning of the commit message.
We wanted to try and find out the statistics of who’d been pairing with each other and therefore needed to extract the pairs from commits.</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time today trying to put together a quick script which would allow me to grab story numbers from the commits in our Git repository and then work out which functional areas those stories were in by querying mingle.
Therefore I wanted to make a curl request to the mingle and then pipe that result somewhere and run an xpath expression to get my element.</description>

      <description>The last couple of applications I’ve worked on have had almost completely read only databases where we had to populate the database in an offline process and then provide various ways for users to access the data.
This creates an interesting situation with respect to how we should setup our development environment.
Our normal setup would probably have an individual version of that database on every development machine and we would populate and then truncate the database during various test scenarios.</description>

      <description>My colleague Pat Fornasier has been using an interesting spin on the idea of making decisions at the last responsible moment by encouraging our team to &amp;#39;feel the pain&amp;#39; before introducing any constraint in our application.
These are some of the decisions which we’ve been delaying/are still delaying:
Dependency Injection Everyone in our team comes from a Java/C# background and one of the first technical decisions that gets made on applications in those languages is which dependency injection container to use.</description>

The stages of the import process are as follows:
Extract a bunch of ZIP files to the disc
Processing only the XML documents...
Load the XML document and determine whether the document is valid to import</description>

      <description>We were doing a bit of profiling of a data importing process we’ve been running across various environments and wanted to check whether or not one of the environments was a physical machine or a VM.
A bit of googling first led me to the following site where you can fill a MAC address and it will tell you which vendor it belongs to.
macvendorlookup.com is even better though because it’s more easily scriptable!</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago I attended Michael Feathers&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Brutal Refactoring&amp;#39; workshop at XP 2011 where he opined that developers generally do the easiest thing when it comes to code bases.
More often than not this means adding to an existing method or existing class rather than finding the correct place to put the behaviour that they want to add.
Something interesting that I’ve noticed so far on the project I’m working on is that so far we haven’t been seeing the same trend.</description>

      <description>We’re using Fedora on our local developer work stations and some of the default key bindings of the operating system seem to conflict with ones provided by IntelliJ IDEA.
One particular amusing one is &amp;#39;Ctrl-Alt-F7&amp;#39; which you use in IntelliJ to see the usages of a piece of code.
In Fedora that seems to switch into a different X Server session and you just see a blank screen with seemingly no way out!</description>

      <description>I’ve been thinking a bit about Parkinson’s Law recently and its&amp;#39; applicability in software development.
Parkinson’s law is defined as follows:
Parkinson’s Law is the adage first articulated by Cyril Northcote Parkinson as the first sentence of a humorous essay published in The Economist in 1955: “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion”
My colleagues quite frequently reference this law with respect to stories taking the amount of time that reflects the story point estimate assigned to them.</description>

      <description>My former colleague Ade Oshineye recently linked me to a post he’s written about Developer Experience (#devexp) which is described as:
[...] an aspirational movement that seeks to apply the techniques of User Experience (UX) professionals to the tools and services that we offer to developers.&amp;#34;
I think it’s quite an interesting idea and I particularly like two of the ideas suggested:
2. Focus on the &amp;#39;5 minute Out Of Box experience&amp;#39; The idea here is that if you provide a library, developers should be able to go from downloading to &amp;#34;Hello World&amp;#34; in 5 minutes.</description>

      <description>I’ve been reading Donella Meadows&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Thinking In Systems: A Primer&amp;#39;, an introductory text on systems thinking, and after 30 pages or so the author poses the following challenge:
Sometimes I challenge my students to try to think of any human decision that occurs without a feedback loop - that is, a decision that is made without regard to any information about the level of stock that it influences
Meadows has quite a nice way of guiding us to thinking about systems by referring to &amp;#39;stocks&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;flows&amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>I recently came across David McRaney’s post about the sunk cost fallacy with reference to Farmville, a fallacy that is very applicable to software.
David starts off with the following statements which describe the fallacy pretty well:
The Misconception: You make rational decisions based on the future value of objects, investments and experiences. The Truth: Your decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in an earlier post I’ve been playing the role of tech lead on the project that we’ve been doing at ThoughtWorks University so I thought it’d be interesting to note down some of my observations so far.
Out of the tech leads that I’ve had I liked the style of Dave Cameron the best.
He viewed himself more as a technical facilitator rather than as a person who should make every single decision about how a system got built which meant that others also got a chance to take some responsibility.</description>

      <description>Last week my colleague T.C. and I had to work out how to HTML encode the values entered by the user when redisplaying those onto the page to prevent a cross site scripting attack on the website.
I wrote a blog post a couple of years ago describing how to do this in ASP.NET MVC and the general idea is that we need to have a custom renderer which HTML encodes any strings that pass through it.</description>

We’re using cctray on a Windows box for that purpose which means that we need to have the file in the &amp;#39;wav&amp;#39; format.
Unfortunately &amp;#39;say&amp;#39; doesn’t seem to be able to output a file in that format:

      <description>One of the aspects of software development that I’ve thankfully seen relatively infrequently over the last few years is that of some people in teams working long hours on a consistent basis.
I have seen it happen on a few occasions and I think it can have a detrimental effect on a team rather than the good which is presumably intended.
The biggest disadvantage is that it makes other people in the team feel guilty that they aren’t working long hours and they may feel peer pressured into matching the hours of their colleagues.</description>

      <description>I’ve mentioned confirmation bias in a few of my previous blog posts but I hadn’t realised quite how widespread it can be in organisations until quite recently.
Confirmation bias
[A] tendency for people to favor information that confirms their preconceptions or hypotheses regardless of whether the information is true. As a result, people gather evidence and recall information from memory selectively, and interpret it in a biased way. The biases appear in particular for emotionally significant issues and for established beliefs.</description>

We can access the system clipboard via the &amp;#39;+&amp;#39; buffer so the commands revolve around that.
Copying to the clipboard To copy the whole file to the clipboard we can use this command:</description>

      <description>Irfan and I were looking at how to do some text substitution in a text file this afternoon and turned to sed to help us in our quest.
He had originally used grep to find what he wanted to replace on each line, using a grep regular expression to match one or more numbers:
cat the_file.txt | grep &amp;#34;[0-9]\+&amp;#34; That works pretty well but since I knew how to do the substitution in sed we needed to convert the regular expression to work with sed.</description>

I wanted to note them down so that I’m more aware that these might be common areas to improve on for university graduates that I work with in the future.
Naming of things I don’t remember there being that much focus on naming variables/methods/classes in any of the programming courses that I studied.</description>

      <description>While trawling the comments of Dan North’s &amp;#39;Deliberate Discovery&amp;#39; post I came across an interesting article written by Phillip G. Armour titled &amp;#39;The Five Orders of Ignorance&amp;#39;.
The main thing I took from the article is that the author uses the metaphor of software as a &amp;#39;knowledge acquisition activity&amp;#39; for which he then defines five orders of ignorance that we can have in our attempts to acquire that knowledge.</description>

      <description>Towards the end of Dan North’s post on Deliberate Discovery he makes the following suggestion:
There is much more to say about deliberate discovery. Think about applying the principle to learning a new language, or picking up a new technology, or a new domain. What could you do to identify and reduce your ignorance most rapidly?
This reminded me a lot of what I used to do when I came across things that I didn’t know how to do a few years ago.</description>

      <description>I recently travelled to London and back for Christmas using Jet Airways and the whole journey got off to an &amp;#39;interesting&amp;#39; start.
I originally booked two Jet Airways flights - one from Pune to Delhi and another from Delhi to London.
A couple of weeks later I was sent an email cancelling my Pune to Delhi flight and informing me that I should contact their customer support centre.
I quickly browsed their website to check what had happened to my flight and found out that it had actually changed from being a Jet Airways flight and was now in fact a Jet Lite flight - their sister airline.</description>

      <description>Ashwin and I were recently discussing integration points in software systems and in particular how many systems are designed in such a way that they will stop the user from going any further if one of those integration points is down.
The main point in favour of designing systems in this way is that it’s logically very simple - all operations are synchronous and we don’t have to worry about any offline processing.</description>

      <description>I’ve been using Vim instead of RubyMine for the last month or so and it’s been interesting observing the way that I browse code as I add plugins to make my life easier.
Between files I generally don’t know exactly where in the folder structure different files live since I’m used to being able to search by just the name i.e. RubyMine’s Ctrl-N
Yahuda Katz wrote a blog post earlier in the year where he listed some of the plugins he’s been using - one of which is called Command-T and allows exactly this functionality.</description>

      <description>I’ve been reading The Goal over the last week or so where Eliyahu Goldratt describes the theory of constraints as a philosophy for allowing organisations to continually achieve their goal.
Goldratt goes on to describe bottlenecks - resources which have a capacity less than the capacity being demanded of the system.
The capacity of the system cannot be higher than that of the bottleneck which means that we need to find a way to optimise the bottlenecks in any system.</description>

      <description>I’ve been reading some of the articles written about the disruption caused by the snow across Europe and I found one quote in The Daily Telegraph by Phillip Hammond particularly interesting
&amp;#34;I think whilst people are obviously deeply upset about the inconvenience, particularly at this time of year, of having their travel plans disrupted, most of what I am hearing is a sense of outrage about the way they were then treated when they were stranded at Heathrow airport.</description>

      <description>Some colleagues have been asking me recently what cultural differences I’ve noticed working in India compared to my experiences in the UK and Australia and one of the biggest differences by far is the amount of tolerance and patience people here have compared to me.
These attributes seem to show themselves in roughly two situations:
With respect to the environment We’ve had some building work done in the Pune office recently which has meant that there’s been extremely high volume drilling being done to the extent that you can barely hear someone who’s sitting a couple of metres away.</description>

      <description>Back in 2007/2008 when I worked on my first couple of projects at ThoughtWorks I always found it strange how frequently my colleagues would try and figure something out themselves rather than asking someone else (who already knew how to do it) how to do it.
Fast forward to 2010 and I find myself being the one encouraging people to figure things out themselves.
There’s still merit in communicating with colleagues when we’ve tried to work out how to do something and haven’t managed to figure it out but it’s also useful to not have this as our default mode.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:8000/blog/2010/12/12/bugs-prioritising-by-bucket/</guid>
      <description>At a lot of organisations that I’ve worked there is a tendency to prioritise bugs by a priority bucket.
We might therefore have priority buckets 1-4 where the bucket number indicates how important the bug is to fix and then any buckets ranked below 4 would not be fixed but would be logged anyway.
From what I’ve noticed this isn’t a particularly effective way of managing bugs.
To start with there tend to be a lot of discussions around what the priority of each bug should be where a QA will argue that it should be a higher priority while a developer disagrees.</description>

      <description>A few colleagues have asked me why I chose to work in India so I thought it would be interesting to explore what it is that appealed to me about working here.
I’ve come to the conclusion that there were 2 main drivers for me:
The buzz of the ThoughtWorks office I was in Bangalore in 2006 when I attended ThoughtWorks University and one of the things that stood out for me was the atmosphere in the Diamond District office.</description>

In the talk Jeff cites globo.com as a case study of a company which is using an agile approach to development of their website but are starting to doubt whether it’s the best way to go about things.</description>

I was describing some of the things that I wanted to change on my team and she pointed out that I always described each change as something that I wanted to change rather than something which I wanted to see change.</description>

      <description>A colleague and I ran into an interesting problem today which we wanted to use local port forwarding to solve.
In our environment.rb file we have a Solr instance url defined like so:
SOLR_CONFIG = { :service_url =&amp;gt; &amp;#34;http://some.internal.address:9983/solr/sco_slave_1&amp;#34; } It’s defined like that because our colleagues in Chicago have setup a Solr instance on a test environment and all the developers hit the same box.
In Pune everyone has Solr configured on their own box so we really wanted to configure that url to be &amp;#39;localhost&amp;#39; on port &amp;#39;8983&amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>Something which I’ve become fairly convinced about recently is that the environment that someone works in has far more impact on their perceived performance than their own individual skills.
Given that belief I’ve often got stuck answering why some people are better able to handle a difficult environment than others - in terms of accepting the situation and finding a way of being productive regardless.
Does this mean that they’re better than people who can’t work in that environment as effectively?</description>

      <description>Just over a year ago I wrote a post about learning one thing each day and since I’ve been struggling to do this lately I thought I’d come back to this topic again.
My general thinking at the time I wrote that post was that sometimes it would be really difficult to find a way to learn anything on the project I was working on and the only way to learn would be to play around with something outside work.</description>

      <description>One of the cool things about software development is that despite writing code for 5 years professionally and just under 10 altogether, there are still a phenomenal number of things that I don’t know how to do.
The learning opportunities are vast!
One of the areas which I’ve known I don’t know that much about is Unix command line tools such as awk and sed.
Since the majority of projects that I’ve worked on have involved using Windows as the development environment I’ve never had extended exposure to the types of problems we get on a project which require their use.</description>

      <description>Priyank and I have been pairing a bit lately and we thought it’d be interesting to try and not use the mouse for anything that we had to do while pairing.
Editor Priyank uses GVim (Yehuda Katz recommends MacVim if you’re using Mac OS) so we already don’t need to use the mouse at all when we’re inside the editor.
One annoying thing we found is that sometimes we wanted to copy stuff from the terminal into GVim and couldn’t think of a good way to do that without selecting the text on the terminal with a mouse and then &amp;#39;Ctrl-C’ing.</description>

I think the overall point that he makes is very true:
We can switch our attention quickly from one task to another. But …​ is it good for our brain? Is it good for the work we are doing?</description>

      <description>In Continuous Delivery the authors talk about the danger of ultimate configurability…​
Configurable software is not always the cheaper solution it appears to be. It’s almost always better to focus on delivering the high-value functionality with little configuration and then add configuration options later when necessary
…​and from my experience when you take this over configurability to its logical conclusion you end up developing a framework that can hopefully just be &amp;#39;configured&amp;#39; for any number of &amp;#39;front ends&amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>Seth Godin recently wrote a post about &amp;#39;the fear tax&amp;#39; which he describes as a &amp;#39;tax&amp;#39; that we pay when we do something in order to try and calm our fear about something else but don’t necessarily end up calming those fears.
We pay the fear tax every time we spend time or money seeking reassurance. We pay it twice when the act of seeking that reassurance actually makes us more anxious, not less.</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time working through the first Micro Testing album of the Industrial Logic eLearning suite a few weeks ago and there’s an interesting piece of advice towards the end of the album:
Microtesting is not a formula. It’s a technique. When microtesting rigorously, you will be called constantly to make judgments like these, between one set of names and another, and their corresponding approaches. Remember the judgment premise.</description>

Bryan suggests that when we have a failing test our next step should be to make that test pass or at least write some code which results in us getting a different error message and hopefully one step closer to making the test pass.</description>

We showcased this piece of functionality to the rest of the team in Firefox and it all worked correctly.
Our business analyst, who was also acting as QA, then had a look at the story in Internet Explorer 6 and we promptly realised that the way we’d solved the problem didn’t actually work in IE6.</description>

      <description>On the project that I’ve been working on over the past few months one of the key benefits of the application was its ability to perform various calculations based on user input.
In order to check that these calculators are producing the correct outputs we created a series of acceptance tests that ran directly against one of the objects in the system.
We did this by defining the inputs and expected outputs for each scenario in an excel spreadsheet which we converted into a CSV file before reading that into an NUnit test.</description>

      <description>I recently watched a presentation given by Joshua Kerievsky from the Lean Software &amp;amp; Systems conference titled &amp;#39;The Limited Red Society&amp;#39; in which describes an approach to refactoring where we try to minimise the amount of time that the code is in a &amp;#39;red&amp;#39; state.
This means that the code should be compiling and the tests green for as much of this time as possible .
I think it’s very important to follow these principles in order to successfully refactor code on a project team and it’s an approach that my colleague Dave Cameron first introduced me to when we worked together last year.</description>

      <description>I’ve written previously about the Mikado method and how I’ve made use of it for identifying ways in which I could refactor code but I think this approach is more generally applicable for any kind of code investigation.
Our application has a lot of calculations in it and we’ve been trying to refactor the code which wires all the calculators up to make use of a DSL which reveals the intention of the code more as well as making it easier to test.</description>

      <description>Something which Dermot, Christian and I noticed last week is that on our project we’ve reached the stage where we intuitively know what the underlying problem is for any given error message in the application we’re working on.
We’re pretty much at the stage where we’re effectively pattern matching what’s going on without needing to think that much anymore.
This is a good thing because it saves a lot of time analysing every single message to try and work out what’s going on - I think this means that we’ve reached a higher level of the Dreyfus model when it comes to this particular situation.</description>

      <description>Ken Schwaber recently wrote a blog post where he compared the differences between the kanban, lean and scrum approaches to software development and although I haven’t had the same experiences as he has with the first two, one interesting thing he implies is that with a scrum approach we have slack time built in.
God help us. People found ways to have slack in waterfall, to rest and be creative.</description>

      <description>I gave a presentation at our ThoughtWorks Brazil office in Porto Alegre last way on some of the things that I’ve learned while working at ThoughtWorks and the first point I made was that it was better to &amp;#39;ask for forgiveness, not for permission&amp;#39;.
This was something that was taught to me a few years ago and the idea behind this is that if there’s some idea we want to try out it makes much more sense to start trying it now and then we can always apologise later on if someone has a problem with us doing that.</description>

      <description>Phil wrote an interesting post recently about the Ubuntu decision making process with respect to design and suggested that we should look to follow something similar on agile software development teams.
The Ubuntu design process basically comes down to this:
This is not a democracy. Good feedback, good data, are welcome. But we are not voting on design decisions.
Phil suggests the following:
That doesn’t mean that there is an Architect (capital A, please), designing the system for the less-skilled developers to write.</description>

      <description>Pat Kua recently wrote a retrospective of his time working at ThoughtWorks and since I recently finished the first project I’ve worked on in 2010 I thought it would be interesting to have a look at what I’d learned and observed while working on it.
&amp;#34;Perfect&amp;#34; code I’ve previously believed that driving for the cleanest code with the least duplication and best structured object oriented design was the way to go but on this project we favoured a simpler design which felt quite procedural in comparison to some of the code bases I’ve worked on.</description>

      <description>We recently ran into an interesting problem when running the website we’re building on our &amp;#39;user replica machine&amp;#39; where you can access the application via a web browser running on Citrix.
The problem we were having was that the result of a post redirect get request that we were making via the jQuery Form plugin was failing to update the fragment of the page correctly. It looked like it was replacing it with the original HTML.</description>

It’s an interesting post and towards the end he states the following:
Given these two compelling justifications for starting with end-to-end tests, why is it that many people apparently don’t start there? We came up with two possibilities, although there may be many others:</description>

      <description>As part of our continuous integration build we have a step in the build which tears down a Windows service, uninstalls it and then reinstalls it later on from the latest files checked into the repository.
One problem we’ve been having recently is that despite the fact it should already have been uninstalled a lock has been kept on the log4net dll in our build directory, a directory that we tear down as one of the next steps.</description>

Neal defines these terms like so:
Essential complexity is the core of the problem we have to solve, and it consists of the parts of the software that are legitimately difficult problems.</description>

      <description>I’ve spent a bit of time working with Les recently and it’s been quite interesting working out the best way for us to pair together as he’s working as a front end developer on the team which means he’s best utilised working on the CSS/JavaScript/HTML side of things.
Having said that there are often features which require both front end and backend collaboration and we’ve been trying to drive these features from the front end through to the backend rather than working on the backend code separately and then working with Les later on to hook it all up to the frontend.</description>

      <description>Alan Atlas has a recent blog post where he discusses agile, lean and scrum and suggests that you can’t truly achieve agility unless your company is fully committed to it which differs slightly from my experiences.
Alan makes a valid point that we’re not really following an approach just because we use all the practices:
Many people make the mistake of viewing Scrum and Agile and Lean as sets of practices.</description>

If there are minor bugs, ship it as soon you have the core scenarios nailed and ship the bug ﬁxes to web gradually after that.</description>

The idea with outside in development as I understand it is that we would look to drive any new functionality from the UI i.</description>

Phil has written a post about the article from the angle of his experience working with these types of companies and working out how to get something into production but as I read this article it seemed to have some relation to reworking code and why/how we approach this.</description>

      <description>I’m reading through Paul Butcher’s &amp;#39;Debug It&amp;#39; book and one of his suggestions when trying to diagnose a problem in our code is to only change one thing at a time.
In a way this might seem fairly obvious but I’ve certainly fallen into the trap of making multiple changes at the same time in the misled belief that it’ll lead to the problem being solved more quickly.
When making changes to code Butcher has the following piece of advice which I quite like:</description>

      <description>Another paper that I read on my Sydney to London flight was one titled &amp;#39;You and Your Research&amp;#39; by Richard Hamming.
It’s a transcript of a talk that Richard Hamming gave to Bellcore employees at the Morris Research and Engineering Centre in 1986.
The talk is aimed at computer science researchers and Hamming describes ways for them to do the best research that they can. I think several of the ideas in the talk relate to software development as well.</description>

I’m not that bothered what the name is but I was reading the transcript of Fred Brooks&amp;#39; acceptance speech for winning the ACM Allen Newell Award in 1994 titled &amp;#39;The Computer Scientist as Toolsmith&amp;#39; which has some interesting ideas about what our role should be.</description>

The slides for the talk are available on SlideShare.
In this talk Dan leads from the following statement about efficiency:
So here’s the thing, I don’t believe in efficiency. It’s our obsession with efficiency that has got us into the current technology mess, and which has led almost directly to heavy waterfall processes.</description>

      <description>Alongside taking a break from it perhaps one of the most effective ways to solve a tricky problem is to describe it to someone else.
When pairing This typically isn’t a problem when pair programming although it can still happen if a pair stays together too long and both start making the same possibly incorrect assumptions when trying to solve a problem.
In this case it makes sense to call someone else over who can lend a fresh perspective to the problem.</description>

cashto, the guy who wrote the original post, agrees with this in the comments on that post:
Absolutely right. I write apps on mobile devices in C++. What works for me may not work well for someone who designs websites with RoR, and vice versa.</description>

      <description>It strikes me that one of the most important skills to develop in software development is knowing when to keep going with an approach to a problem and when we should stop and try something else.
This situation doesn’t always happen because if we have two people available and realise before we start on the task that there is some doubt as to which solution is the most appropriate then we can adopt a set based approach whereby we try out multiple potential solutions in parallel.</description>

I think the impact new people provide is particularly useful on a challenging project where they may be able to have a much more immediate impact.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a interview with Dave Hoover where he talks through the idea of working as an apprentice software developer and suggests some ways to do this more effectively.
I think the easiest thing to get wrong in software development is to over estimate our ability and there is even a study that proves that theory. Hoover refers to this as &amp;#39;having an accurate self assessment&amp;#39;.
If we work on the same project for a while then we’re going to get pretty good at navigating that code base and we’ll probably be able to solve any problem and add any piece of functionality fairly easily which only helps fuel the belief.</description>

While this approach clearly works well for Ayende I really like the following comment by Alex Simkin:
Anyway, this post should be marked MA (Mature Audience Only), so younger programmers wont use excuse to not write unit tests because Ayende doesn’t do it.</description>

We hadn’t checked in for longer than we would have liked to due to a bit of a checkin pile up which had happened because the build on the CI server had been failing for a few hours due to a temporary problem we were having with an external dependency.</description>

      <description>One of the things that I’ve noticed over the past few years of working on software delivery projects is that the most challenging projects, the ones that most people hate working on, tend to last the longest yet teach you the most although maybe not immediately.
The problem is that a lot of the time we are in a state of frustration with all the things that are wrong about the project and therefore don’t focus on the things that we can do to make our situation better and improve the chances of the project to deliver.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a blog post by Seth Godin where he coins the term &amp;#39;bear shaving&amp;#39; which is where we address the symptoms of a problem instead of addressing the problem.
The main example he gives is the idea of shaving a bear so that it can deal with the increased temperature caused by global warming instead of addressing the underlying problem which has led to this happening in the first place.</description>

      <description>I recently came across an interesting post by Frans Bauma entitled &amp;#39;Think first, doing is for later&amp;#39; which was linked to from Jeremy Miller’s blog entry about incremental delivery and continuous design.
Right now I find myself in favour of Jeremy’s approach which is more about writing some code and then getting some feedback on it and then writing some more code instead of spending a lot of time thinking before we write any code.</description>

      <description>I find one of the most applicable mantras in software development is Bob Sutton’s idea that we should have strong opinions weakly held.
The idea as I understand it is that we shouldn’t sit on the fence but instead have an opinion that we research thoroughly and are prepared to back up. However, we shouldn’t become too attached to those opinions but instead be prepared to listen to alternative points of view and take those on where they prove more useful than our previous opinions.</description>

      <title>Good Lazy and Bad Lazy</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:8000/blog/2009/07/21/good-lazy-and-bad-lazy/</guid>
      <description>One of the things I remember picking up from reading The Pragmatic Programmer is that developers need to be lazy in order to find better ways to solve problems and I came across a post by Philipp Lensson from a few years ago where he also suggests good developers are lazy and dumb.
Something which I’ve come to realise more recently is that it’s not necessarily true that being lazy as a developer is always a good thing - it depends in what way you are being lazy because there are certainly good and bad ways in which you can express your laziness!</description>

      <description>We ran a session on Continuous Integration at the most recent Community College in the ThoughtWorks Sydney office.
It was roughly based around a CI Maturity Model which I recently came across although the intention was to find out what other teams were doing CI wise.
I became a bit more aware of how little I know about CI after listening to a Software Engineering Radio interview with my colleague Chris Read so I was keen to see how other teams are approaching this problem.</description>

      <title>Using Fiddler with IIS</title>

      <description>We’ve been using Fiddler to debug the requests and responses sent via web services to a service layer our application interacts with and it works pretty well when you run the application using Cassini but by default won’t work when you run the website through IIS.
The key to this as one of my colleagues (who gives credit to Erik) showed me today is to ensure that IIS is running under the same user that Fiddler is running under which in our case is the &amp;#39;Administrator&amp;#39; account.</description>

      <description>I pick up Michael Feathers&amp;#39; Working Effectively with Legacy Code book from time to time and one of my favourite parts of the book is the chapter where he talks about &amp;#39;Seams&amp;#39;.
To quote the book:
A seam is a place where you can alter behaviour in your program without editing in that place
Seams in the book are generally discussed in terms of how we can get tests around legacy code which was written without easy testability in mind but I’ve noticed that the ideas behind seams seem to be more widely applicable than this.</description>

      <description>I recently read a post by my colleague Sai Venkatakrishnan where he talks about some of the disadvantages of over working on a project and it reminded me of something I’ve noticed a lot recently - notably that after taking a break from solving a problem, either by looking at it again the next day or after lunch or any kind of break I end up solving it significantly more quickly than if I’d kept on trying to solve it without doing so.</description>

      <description>The Book 97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know by Richard Monson-Haefel
The Review My colleague Erik Doernenburg mentioned that he had written a couple of chapters in this book a while ago and there was a copy of the book in the ThoughtWorks office so I thought I’d take a look.
I’m far from being an architect but since their decisions affect what I do I was intrigued to see what they should be doing.</description>

      <description>Pat Kua has a recent post where he talks about the language used between testers and developers when talking about defects that testers come across when testing some functionality and while I would agree with him that the language used is important, I’ve always found that injecting some humour into the situation takes the edge off.
As Dahlia points out I think this is probably only possible if there is good rapport between the developers and testers on the team so perhaps this has been the case for the teams I’ve worked on.</description>

The slides for the talk are here and it’s also available on InfoQ.
What did I learn? I quite liked the way the talk was laid out - Dan laid out a series of problems that he’s seen on some projects he’s worked on and then showed on the next slide where he planned to take the architecture.</description>

      <description>One interesting situation that we often arrive at when writing code is working out when the best time to apply a level of abstraction is.
I think there is always a trade off to be made when it comes to creating abstractions - creating the abstraction adds to the complexity of the code we’re writing but it is often the case that creating it makes it easier for us to navigate the code base.</description>

      <description>An interesting thing that I’ve started to notice recently with regards to software development books is that I get a lot more from reading the book the second time compared to what I did reading the book the first time.
I’ve noticed this for several books, including The Pragmatic Programmer, Code Complete and Domain Driven Design, so my first thought was that perhaps I had read this books too early when I didn’t have the necessary context or experience to gain value from reading them.</description>

      <description>As we know with software development with pretty much every decision we make or technology we choose there is a trade off that goes with making this choice as compared with choosing an alternative.
I first learnt this when working with Ade a couple of years ago and while I know it to be true, I had come to believe that some practices are just non-negotiable and we should look to apply them judiciously wherever possible.</description>

      <description>I previously wrote about protecting websites from cross site scripting in the ASP.NET MVC framework by encoding user input when we are going to display it in the browser.
We can either choose to encode data like this or we can encode it straight away when we get it.
There did not seem to be a consensus on the best approach in a discussion on the ASP.NET forums but we believe it is far better to encode the data when it is outgoing rather than incoming.</description>

      <description>I’ve been reading the transcript of Joel Spolsky/Jeff Atwood’s podcast discussion on TDD/Quality and related posts on the subject by Uncle Bob and Ron Jeffries and while I guess it’s fairly inevitable that I’m likely to side with the latter two, what I’ve realised is that I get the greatest enjoyment from my job when we are writing high quality software.
Certainly delivering value to customers in a timely manner is important but if we’re not producing something that we’re proud to have written then I think we’re doing ourselves and our customer a disservice.</description>

      <description>Technical debt is a term coined by Martin Fowler which we tend to use on our projects to describe a number of different situations on projects as Ian Cartwright points out in his post on the subject.
Ian covers it in more detail, but to summarise my understanding of what technical debt actually is:
Technical debt is where we know that something we choose not to take care of now is going to affect us in the future.</description>

      <description>Another of the ideas I have picked up from my lean reading is that of trying things out without understanding exactly what is happening.
Or as The Toyota Way puts it…​
There are many things one doesn’t understand and therefore, we ask them why don’t you just go ahead and take action; try to do something?
This is an approach which several colleagues I have worked with recently have been encouraging me to follow.</description>

      <description>About 8 or 9 months ago I remember having a conversation with a colleague where I asked him where he had got his almost encyclopedic knowledge of all things software development.
His reply at the time was that he read a lot of blogs and that this was where he had picked up a lot of the information.
While subscribing to different blogs remains a useful way of learning about different aspects of software development, I think Twitter is now becoming a very useful complementary tool to use alongside the RSS reader.</description>

      <description>We’ve been working quite a bit with jQuery and cross browser compatibility and one of the interesting differences we came across today was the behaviour of Firefox and Internet Explorer when it comes to refreshing a page.
When you press refresh in Internet Explorer the page gets refreshed to the state that it was in when you first loaded the URL, meaning that the state of the data in forms is returned to its original state.</description>

      <description>Last week I came across what I have decided is the file system equivalent of commenting out code - not deleting directories when we are no longer using them.
The specific situation we ran into was while trying to make some Tomcat configuration changes but everything we changed was having no effect on what we were seeing on the web site.
Eventually we realised that we were actually changing the configuration in the wrong place - we actually had two Tomcat folder lying around.</description>

      <description>One of the very common pitfalls I make when working on things is to get so engrossed in the technical details of the problem that I completely forget the reason for doing it in the first place.
Over the last week or so I have noticed myself trying to solve some ridiculous problems without considering whether I am solving the right problem in the first place.
To give an example, I was working with Hibernate earlier in the week trying to setup a new mapping between two entities which involved creating a composite key on one of the entities, which led to us having to work out how to do that on the database, then editing our migration script, then trawling Google to work out why our mapping wasn’t working, before a colleague overheard our pain and pointed out that we had over complicated matters.</description>

The code base where I initially came across the feature misused it quite severely but it got me thinking about other language features I have come across which can add great value when used effectively but lead to horrific problems when misused.</description>

      <description>On one of my previous projects one of the problems that we had to solve was how to handle balances - we were working on a cash service for a financial services company.
The main discussion often centres around how often the balance should be updated. From my experience there are two main ways that we can go about this:
Real time update after every transaction This is perhaps the most obvious approach and the implementation is fairly simple.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:8000/blog/2008/08/18/from-prototype-to-delivery/</guid>
      <description>Projects often reach the interesting point where the prototyping and development phases intersect and there are some interesting decisions to make.
From a development point of view the biggest decision is what to do with the code that has been developed.
When developing prototypes the focus tends to be on getting something to work quick and dirty. Not a lot of time is put into considering edge cases or error conditions or any of the other niceties that are needed for software to be usable in an enterprise environment.</description>

      <description>When pair programming there are obviously times when you have different opinions about how things should be done.
One of these is the way that we should return from methods. There seem to be two approaches when it comes to this:
Exit as quickly as possible The goal with this approach is as the title suggests, to get out of the method at the earliest possible moment.
The Guard Block is the best example of this.</description>
