      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to see the error in approach if there is an approach! On one occasion where I hadn&amp;rsquo;t planned out an approach I ended up staring at the question for 10 minutes and didn&amp;rsquo;t make any progress at all.
e.g. one exercise was to calculate the 5th percentile of a posterior distribution which I flailed around with for 15 minutes before giving up. Watching back on the video it was obvious that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t completely understood what a probability mass functionwas.</description>

      <description>If one player&amp;rsquo;s rating increases by x, the opponent&amp;rsquo;s rating does not usually decrease by x as in the Elo system.
In fact, in the Glicko system, the amount by which the opponent&amp;rsquo;s rating decreases is governed by both players&amp;rsquo; RD&amp;rsquo;s.

      <description>To behave like a hacker, you have to believe that the thinking time of other hackers is precious — so much so that it’s almost a moral duty for you to share information, solve problems and then give the solutions away just so other hackers can solve new problems instead of having to perpetually re-address old ones.</description>

      <description>The mistake, which Wald saw instantly, was that the holes showed where the planes were strongest. The holes showed where a bomber could be shot and still survive the flight home, Wald explained. After all, here they were, holes and all. It was the planes that weren’t there that needed extra protection, and they had needed it in places that these planes had not. The holes in the surviving planes actually revealed the locations that needed the least additional armor.</description>

      <description>Baumeister&amp;rsquo;s group has repeatedly found that an effort of will or self control is tiring; if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around.
The phenomenon has been named ego depletion.</description>

      <description>To behave like a hacker, you have to believe that the thinking time of other hackers is precious — so much so that it&amp;rsquo;s almost a moral duty for you to share information, solve problems and then give the solutions away just so other hackers can solve new problems instead of having to perpetually re-address old ones.</description>

      <description>A common approach we&amp;rsquo;ve been taking on some of the applications I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on recently is to decompose the system we&amp;rsquo;re building into smaller micro serviceswhich are independently deployable and communicate with each other over HTTP.
An advantage of decomposing systems like that is that we could have separate teams working on each service and then make use of a consumer driven contractas a way of ensuring the contract between them is correct.</description>

      <description>In my continued attempts at the Kaggle Digit Recognizerproblem I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with the encoglibrary to try and build a neural networks solution to the problem.
Unfortunately it&amp;rsquo;s not quite working at the moment so I wanted to debug the code and see whether the input parameters were being correctly translated from the CSV file.
Each input is an array containing 784 values but by default IntelliJ restricts you to seeing 100 elements which wasn&amp;rsquo;t helpful in my case since the early values tend to all be 0 and it&amp;rsquo;s not until you get half way through that you see different values:</description>

      <description>For at least the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve heard colleagues talk about working out the core competency of our clients businesses and I&amp;rsquo;d confused myself into thinking that the software we helped them build was the core competency.
I think Martin Fowler best explains how technology and business core competences work in his post about utility and strategic projectswhere he describes the difference between these like so:
The thing I&amp;rsquo;d be getting confused about was thinking that the software isthe core competency but as Martin points out the software is actually there to supportthe core competency.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my previous postwe&amp;rsquo;ve been making it possible to deploy our application to a new environment and as part of this we defined an upstartscript which would run the JAR.
We tend to edit code on Windows and then test it out on the vagrant VM afterwards.
The end of our upstart script looked a bit like this:
script cd /opt/app java -jar /opt/app/app.jar /opt/app/config.yml end script Unfortunately when we tried to launch the application using &amp;lsquo;start app&amp;rsquo; we got this error:</description>

      <description>I recently came across a really interesting post about black box abstractionby Angeleah where she talks about developers desire to know how things work and the need to understand when and when not to follow that instinct.
Angeleah defines black box abstraction like so:
We have to be particularly careful about knowing how far to look inside the black box when working with new systems that we know nothing about.</description>

      <description>Over the past couple of years I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on several different applications and one thing they had in common was that they had a huge feature which would take a few months to complete and initially seemed difficult to break down.
Since we favoured an incremental/iterative approach to building these features and wanted to add value in short feedback cycles we needed to find a way to break them down.</description>

      <description>My colleague Erik Doernenburghas written a couple of articles recently discussing the reasons why people buyand build IT solutionsand one part in particular resonated with me:
I feel like there&amp;rsquo;s a mindset change once you start thinking which package you could buy to solve your problem whereby you stop solving the problem you actually have and focus instead on what features the package offers.
Package software almost by definition tends to be written for a generic case of a problem and as Erik points out might not solve the problem that a business has.</description>

      <description>One of the most unexpected things that I picked up while pairing with Ashokfor a few days in August/September is his ability to pick the simplest solutionwhen confronted with a problem.
On numerous occasions we&amp;rsquo;d be trying to do something and I&amp;rsquo;d end up on a yak shaving mission trying to get a complicated approach to work while he watched on with bemusement.
I thought I&amp;rsquo;d actually learnt this lesson from working with Ashok but on a couple of occasions over the last week I&amp;rsquo;ve caught myself doing the same thing again!</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re using varnishto cache all the requests that come through our web servers and especially in our pre-production environments we deploy quite frequently and want to see the changes that we&amp;rsquo;ve made.
This means that we need to purge the pages we&amp;rsquo;re accessing from varnish so that it will actually pass the request through to the application server and serve up the latest version of the page.
For some reason my google-fu when trying to remember/work out how to do this has always been weak but my colleague Shodhanhelped me understand how to do this today so I thought I better record it so I don&amp;rsquo;t forget!</description>

We wanted to check what the open file descriptors of logstash-client were so we first had to grab its process id:

(Almost) Following the instructions from the home page we added the following to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy:
Acquire::http::Proxy &amp;#34;http://apt-cache-server:3142&amp;#34; And when we ran &amp;lsquo;apt-get update&amp;rsquo; we were getting the following error:

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been loading some data into neo4j from a CSV file - creating one node per row and using the value in the first column as the index lookup for the node.
Unfortunately the index lookup wasn&amp;rsquo;t working for the first row but was for every other row.
By coincidence we started saving each row into a hash map and were then able to see what was going wrong:

This is certainly something I imagine that most people have experienced, perhaps for the first time at school when we realised that the best teacher of a subject isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily the person who is best at the subject.</description>

      <description>I started playing around with the TFL Bus stop location and routes APIand one of the annoying things about the data is that it uses easting/northingvalues to describe the location of bus stops rather than lat/longs.
The first few lines of the CSV filelook like this:
1000,91532,490000266G,WESTMINSTER STN &amp;lt;&amp;gt; / PARLIAMENT SQUARE,530171,179738,177,0K08,0 10001,72689,490013793E,TREVOR CLOSE,515781,174783,78,NB16,0 10002,48461,490000108F,HIGHBURY CORNER,531614,184603,5,C902,0 For each of the stops I wanted to convert from the easting/northing value to the equivalent lat/long value but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a simple way of doing it in code although I did come across an API that would do it for me.</description>

      <description>For the last 5 weeks or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with puppetevery day to automate the configuration of various nodes in our stack and my most interesting observation so far is that you really need to keep your discipline when doing this type of work.
We can keep that discipline in three main ways when developing modules.
When it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;just little bits&amp;rsquo; there is a massive temptation to make changes manually and then retrospectively put it into a puppet module and assume that it will workif we run from scratch.</description>

      <description>I recently read a blog post by Julian Boot titled &amp;lsquo;visualisation without analysis is fine&amp;rsquo; where he suggests that we can learn things from visualising data in the right way - detailed statistical analysis isn&amp;rsquo;t always necessary.
I thought this was quite an interesting observation because over the past couple of months I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with ThoughtWorks data and looking at different ways to visualise aspects of the data.</description>

      <description>My colleague Shohdanand I spent a couple of days last week wiring up various monitoring metrics into ganglia and while most of them come built in, we also found some python based modules that we wanted to use.
Unfortunately we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any instructions on github explaining how to set them up but after a bit of trial and error we figured it out.
One of the modules that we wanted to use was diskstatwhich provides I/O wait time metrics which we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find in the built in modules.</description>

      <description>On the project I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on we&amp;rsquo;re doing quite a bit of puppet and although we&amp;rsquo;re using the puppet master approach in production &amp;amp; test environments it&amp;rsquo;s still useful to be able to run puppet headless to test changes locally.
Since several of the commands require having write access to &amp;lsquo;root&amp;rsquo; folders we need to run &amp;lsquo;puppet apply&amp;rsquo; as a super user using sudo. We also need to run it in the context of some environment variables which the root user has.</description>

      <description>Over the last six months or so I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with a bunch of different people and one of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is that when something isn&amp;rsquo;t working there tend to be two quite distinct ways that people go about trying to solve the problem.
The RTFMcrowd will go straight for the official documentation or source code if needs be in an attempt to work through the problem from first principals.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a presentation for the ThoughtWorks Europe away day over the last few days and I created some screen casts using Camtasiawhich I wanted to include.
It&amp;rsquo;s reasonably easy to insert movies into Powerpoint but I was finding that when I saved the file and then reloaded it the movies had been converted into images which wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I wanted at all!
Eventually I came across a blog post which explained that I&amp;rsquo;d been saving the file as the wrong format.</description>

      <description>I think one of the first things that I learnt about dealing with users in a data store is that you should never use name as a primary key because their might be two people with the same name.
Despite knowing that I foolishly chose to ignore this knowledge when building my neo4j graph and used name as the key for the Lucene index.
I thought I&amp;rsquo;d got away with it but NO!</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re using the Brightbox Ruby repositoryto get the versions of Ruby which we install on our machines and although we eventually put the configuration for this repository into Puppet we initially tested it out on a local VM.
To start with you need to add the repository to /etc/apt/sources.list:
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/brightbox/ruby-ng/ubuntu lucid main To get that picked up we run the following:
apt-get update Which initially threw this error because it&amp;rsquo;s a gpg signed repository and we hadn&amp;rsquo;t added the key:</description>

We wanted to be able to edit files on the VM from the host O/S so my colleague Philsuggested that we set up a Samba server on the VM and then connect to it from the Mac.
We first needed to install a couple of packages on the VM:</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I asked the twittersphere for some advice on how I could get better at writing recursive functions and one of the pieces of advice was to work through The Little Schemer.
I first heard about The Little Schemer a couple of years ago and after going through the first few pages I got bored and gave up.
I still found the first few pages a bit trivial this time around as well but my colleague Jen Smithencouraged me to keep going and once I&amp;rsquo;d got about 20 pages in it became clearer to me why the first few pages had been written the way they had.</description>

      <description>On the project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on we&amp;rsquo;re building an API to be used by other applications in the organisation but when we started none of those applications were ready to integrate with us and therefore drive the API design.
Initially we tried driving the API through integration style tests but we realised that taking this approach made it quite difficult for us to imagine how an application would use it.</description>

      <description>A couple of years ago I wrote a post describing an approach my then colleague Christian Blundenused to help improve the performance of an application where you try to do expensive things less or find another way to do them.
On the application I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on we load reference data from an Oracle database into memory based on configurations provided by the user.
There are multiple configurations and then multiple ways that those configurations can be priced so we have two nested for loops in which we load data and then perform calculations on it.</description>

      <description>One of the most common instincts of a developer when starting on a new team is to look at the way the application has been designed and find ways that it can be done differently.
Most often &amp;lsquo;differently&amp;rsquo; means that a pattern used in a previous project will be favoured and while I think it&amp;rsquo;s good to make use of experience that we&amp;rsquo;ve gained, we do miss out on some learning if we write every application the same way.</description>

      <description>Everyone now and then we end up having to write a bunch of mapping code and I quite like using IntelliJ&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Replace&amp;rsquo; option to do it but always end up spending about 5 minutes trying to remember how to do capture groups so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write it down this time.
Given the following text in our file:
val mark = 0 val dave = 0 val john = 0 val alex = 0 Let&amp;rsquo;s say we wanted to prefix each of those names with &amp;lsquo;cool&amp;rsquo; and had decided not to use Column mode for whatever reason.</description>

      <description>I recently read the Graphite chapterof The Architecture of Open Source Applicationsbook which mostly tells the story of how Chris Davis incrementally built out Graphite- a pretty cool tool that can be used to do real time graphing of metrics.
The whole chapter is a very good read but I found the design reflections especially interesting:
One of the main success criteria of the application that I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on is its performance - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have millisecond-ish latency requirements but it does need to do a lot of calculations and return within a reasonable amount of time.</description>

      <description>We wanted to be able to retain the value of a drop down menu that was being dynamically populated (via an AJAX call) when the user hit the back button but the AJAX request re-runs when we go hit back therefore losing our selection.
Our initial thinking was that we might be able to store the value of the dropdown in a hidden field and then restore it into the dropdown using jQuery on page load but that approach didn&amp;rsquo;t work since hidden fields don&amp;rsquo;t seem to retain their values when you hit back.</description>

      <description>One of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt while developing code in an incremental way is that the way the code should be designed isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be obvious straight away so we need to be patience and wait for it to emerge.
There&amp;rsquo;s often a tendency to pull out classes or methods but more recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to follow an approach where I leave the code in one class/method and play around with/study it until I see a good abstraction to make.</description>

      <description>On the current application I&amp;rsquo;m working on we need to make use of some data which comes from another system so we&amp;rsquo;ve created an import script which creates a copy of that data so that we can use it in our application.
In general we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying not to do too much manipulation of the data and keeping it close to the initial structure so that if something goes wrong with the import we can more easily trace the problem back to the original data source.</description>

      <description>On the majority of the teams that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on there&amp;rsquo;s been a time where everyone seems to be disagreeing with each other about almost everything and the whole situation becomes pretty tense for all involved.
The first time I came across this it seemed quite dysfunctional but I was introduced to Bruce Tuckman&amp;rsquo;s model of group developmentwhich helps to explain what&amp;rsquo;s going on.
Tuckman outlines four stages which teams tend to go through - forming, storming, norming and performing.</description>

While a tech lead might not like to be referred to as a manager I think part of the role does involve helping developers to make progressand the best ones I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with seem to do that instinctively.
They&amp;rsquo;re able to see when someone has got very stuck with what they&amp;rsquo;re doing and can then work out whether they just need to provide some advice on how they can move forward or if that&amp;rsquo;s not working they can come and work together on the problem.</description>

      <description>In my latest post I described an approach we&amp;rsquo;d been taking when analysing how to rewrite part of an existing system so that we could build the new version in an incremental way.
Towards the end I pointed out that we weren&amp;rsquo;t actually going to be using an incremental approach as we&amp;rsquo;d initially thought which was due to a couple of constraints that we have to work under.
Unfortunately we later on came to learn that it takes around 6-9 months to provision production hardware.</description>

      <description>During December/early January we spent some time analysing an existing system which we were looking to rewrite and our approach was to look for how we could do this in an incremental way.
In order to do that we needed to look for what Michael Feathers refers to as a seam:
On previous times when I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about seams it&amp;rsquo;s been at a code level inside a single application but this time there were more than one pieces interacting.</description>

The aim is to get your scripts to the point where the outcome is reasonably deterministic so that we can have confidence they&amp;rsquo;re going to work the next we run them.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been spending some time trying to setup our developer environment on a Oracle Linux 5.7 build and one of the first steps was to install Puppet as we&amp;rsquo;ve already created scripts which automate the installation of most things.
Unfortunately Oracle Linux builds don&amp;rsquo;t come with any yum repos configured so when you run the following command&amp;hellip;
ls -alh /etc/yum.repos.d/ &amp;hellip;you don&amp;rsquo;t see anything :(
We eventually realised that there are a list of public yum repositories on the Oracle website, of which we needed to download the definition for Oracle Linux 5 like so:</description>

      <description>I recently came across Carl Erickson&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;small teams are dramatically more efficient than large teams&amp;rsquo; blog post which reminded me of something which my colleague Ashoksuggested as a useful way for determining team size - the application footprint.
As I understand it the application footprint is applicable for an application at a given point in time and determines how many parallel tasks/streams of work we have.
In the case of the project that I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on there are 3 separate components which need to interact with each other via an API but otherwise are independent.</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time this afternoon trying to export an Oracle test database so that we could use it locally using the exptool.
I had to connect to exp like this:
exp user/password@remote_address And then filled in the other parameters interactively.
Unfortunately when I tried to actually export the specified tables I got the following error message:
EXP-00008: ORACLE error 904 encountered ORA-00904: &amp;#34;POLTYP&amp;#34;: invalid identifier EXP-00000: Export terminated unsuccessfully I eventually came across Oyvind Isene&amp;rsquo;s blog post which pointed out that you&amp;rsquo;d get this problem if you tried to export a 10g database using an 11g clientwhich is exactly what I was trying to do!</description>

      <description>A couple of years agoI used to write a blog postreflecting on what I&amp;rsquo;d worked on in the preceding year and what I&amp;rsquo;d learned and having read 2011 reviews by a coupleof otherpeopleI thought I&amp;rsquo;d have a go.
Often I&amp;rsquo;d work on something and know exactly how it should be designed and where we could go wrong since I&amp;rsquo;d done the same thing several times before and the challenge of not knowing what to do had disappeared somewhat.</description>

      <description>On a reasonable number of the systems that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on over the past few years there&amp;rsquo;s been a &amp;lsquo;black box&amp;rsquo; component which the team I&amp;rsquo;ve been on has needed to integrate with.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always found it a little strange that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to/want to know how that part of the system worked or that you could actually believe that it was truly a black box.
If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work then you have no way of diagnosing the problem - did you do something wrong, was there something wrong inside the black box or was it something else.</description>

      <description>At XP Day I was chatting to Benjamin Mitchellabout the 5 whysexercisesthat we&amp;rsquo;d tried on my team and I suggested that beyond Eric Ries&amp;rsquo; post on the subjectI hadn&amp;rsquo;t come across an article/video which explained how to do it.
Benjamin mentioned that Douglas Squirrel had recently done a talk on this very subject at Skillsmatter and as with most Skillsmatter talks there&amp;rsquo;s a video of the presentation online.
Gojko wrote a post summarising the talk at the timebut I was interested in seeing how a 5 whys facilitated by Douglas would compare to the ones that we&amp;rsquo;d done.</description>

      <description>Towards the end of the week before last and the beginning of last week we&amp;rsquo;d been having quite a few problems with our QA environment to the point where we were unable to deploy anything to it for 3 days.
A few weeks ago I wrote about a 5 whys exercise that we did in a retrospectiveand in our weekly code review we decided to give it a go and see what we could learn.</description>

      <description>As part of the ingestion process for our application we import XML documents and corresponding PDFs into a database and onto the file system respectively.
Since the user needs to be able to search for documents by the userFacingIdwe reference it by that identifier in the database and the web application.
Each document also has an external identifier and we use this to identify the PDFs on the file system.</description>

      <description>Duncanand I had an interesting problem recently where we had to make it possible to search within an &amp;lsquo;item&amp;rsquo; to find possible sub items that exist inside it.
The URIfor the item was something like this:
/items/234 Let&amp;rsquo;s say Item 234 contains the following sub items:
We have a search box on the page which allows us to type in the name of a sub item and go the sub item&amp;rsquo;s page if it exists or see an error message if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>On my current project we have a wall where we keep track of &amp;lsquo;window fixing&amp;rsquo; tasks - things that people want to fix in the code base but chose to defer until a later date.
Every now and then we take what&amp;rsquo;s on the wall and prioritise it according to Fabio Pereira&amp;rsquo;s effort/pain matrixso that we know which clean up tasks will provide the greatest value to the team.
While I think it&amp;rsquo;s a nice way of getting a team understanding of technical debt I think it can lead to a couple of problems which come with most attempts at group responsibility for something.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my previous post I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a little application to create graphs based on our git repository history and in one of them we wanted to try and create a graph showing which people had been working on which stories.
I needed a way to extract a story number from the git commit message and then store them all in a text file.
A typical commit with a story number in might look like this:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working my way slowly through the O&amp;rsquo;Reilly &amp;lsquo;Mastering Regular Expressions&amp;rsquo; book and recently read about the non capturing match operator which came in useful for some Git log parsing I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing.
On the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on we all commit as the same user and then put our names at the beginning of the commit message.
We wanted to try and find out the statistics of who&amp;rsquo;d been pairing with each other and therefore needed to extract the pairs from commits.</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time today trying to put together a quick script which would allow me to grab story numbers from the commits in our Git repository and then work out which functional areas those stories were in by querying mingle.
Therefore I wanted to make a curlrequest to the mingle and then pipe that result somewhere and run an xpath expression to get my element.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to write code in another script file and then reference that file from the shell and in my search to achieve that I came across XMLStarleton stackoverflow.</description>

      <description>The last couple of applications I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on have had almost completely read only databases where we had to populate the database in an offline process and then provide various ways for users to access the data.
This creates an interesting situation with respect to how we should setup our development environment.
Our normal setup would probably have an individual version of that database on every development machine and we would populate and then truncate the database during various test scenarios.</description>

      <description>My colleague Pat Fornasierhas been using an interesting spin on the idea of making decisions at the last responsible moment by encouraging our team to &amp;lsquo;feel the pain&amp;rsquo; before introducing any constraint in our application.
These are some of the decisions which we&amp;rsquo;ve been delaying/are still delaying:
We decided to just create a trait where we wired up the dependencies ourself and then inject that trait into the entry point of our application.</description>

The stages of the import process are as follows:
We&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this quite a bit recently and one of the main things we&amp;rsquo;ve learnt is the value of gathering detailing information about what&amp;rsquo;s actually happening in the code.</description>

      <description>We were doing a bit of profiling of a data importing process we&amp;rsquo;ve been running across various environments and wanted to check whether or not one of the environments was a physical machine or a VM.
A bit of googling first led me to the following sitewhere you can fill a MAC address and it will tell you which vendor it belongs to.
macvendorlookup.comis even better though because it&amp;rsquo;s more easily scriptable!</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago I attended Michael Feathers&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Brutal Refactoring&amp;rsquo; workshopat XP 2011 where he opined that developers generally do the easiest thing when it comes to code bases.
More often than not this means adding to an existing method or existing class rather than finding the correct place to put the behaviour that they want to add.
Something interesting that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed so far on the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on is that so far we haven&amp;rsquo;t been seeing the same trend.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re using Fedora on our local developer work stations and some of the default key bindings of the operating system seem to conflict with ones provided by IntelliJ IDEA.
One particular amusing one is &amp;lsquo;Ctrl-Alt-F7&amp;rsquo; which you use in IntelliJ to see the usages of a piece of code.
In Fedora that seems to switch into a different X Server session and you just see a blank screen with seemingly no way out!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a bit about Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s Lawrecently and its&amp;rsquo; applicability in software development.
Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s law is defined as follows:
“Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion”
My colleagues quite frequently reference this law with respect to stories taking the amount of time that reflects the story point estimate assigned to them.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed this so much but I think we&amp;rsquo;re more susceptible to the law when what we&amp;rsquo;re working on doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a clear goal or doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a fast feedback loop.</description>

I think it&amp;rsquo;s quite an interesting idea and I particularly like two of the ideas suggested:
The idea here is that if you provide a library, developers should be able to go from downloading to &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; in 5 minutes.
For instance if your users struggle with getting OAuth working then create abstractions that handle it for them rather than documenting the 6 most common problems or writing up the &amp;lsquo;simple 12 step process&amp;rsquo; for getting it working.</description>

Meadows has quite a nice way of guiding us to thinking about systems by referring to &amp;lsquo;stocks&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;flows&amp;rsquo;.
For example the following diagram represents the flows into and out from a water reservoir:
The &amp;lsquo;water in reservoir&amp;rsquo; is the stock in this system while rain/river inflow act as the in flows and evaporation/discharge are the out flows.</description>

      <description>I recently came across David McRaney&amp;rsquo;s post about the sunk cost fallacy with reference to Farmville, a fallacy that is very applicable to software.
David starts off with the following statements which describe the fallacy pretty well:
The Truth: Your decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.
I think this is very true in a lot of IT organisations in particular when they&amp;rsquo;ve made a big investment on some sort of middleware, usually an ESB.</description>

Out of the tech leads that I&amp;rsquo;ve had I liked the style of Dave Cameronthe best.
He viewed himself more as a technical facilitator rather than as a person who should make every single decision about how a system got built which meant that others also got a chance to take some responsibility.</description>

I wrote a blog post a couple of years ago describing how to do this in ASP.NET MVCand the general idea is that we need to have a custom renderer which HTML encodes any strings that pass through it.</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time yesterday afternoon working out how to get the output from the Unix command &amp;lsquo;say&amp;rsquo; to be played whenever our build breaks.
We&amp;rsquo;re using cctrayon a Windows box for that purpose which means that we need to have the file in the &amp;lsquo;wav&amp;rsquo; format.
Unfortunately &amp;lsquo;say&amp;rsquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be able to output a file in that format:
&amp;gt; say &amp;#34;WARNING! Drainage has occurred, please fix it.</description>

      <title>The working long hours culture</title>

      <description>One of the aspects of software development that I&amp;rsquo;ve thankfully seen relatively infrequently over the last few years is that of some people in teams working long hours on a consistent basis.
I have seen it happen on a few occasions and I think it can have a detrimental effect on a team rather than the good which is presumably intended.
The biggest disadvantage is that it makes other people in the team feel guilty that they aren&amp;rsquo;t working long hours and they may feel peer pressured into matching the hours of their colleagues.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned confirmation bias ina fewof my previous blog postsbut I hadn&amp;rsquo;t realised quite how widespread it can be in organisations until quite recently.
Confirmation biasAs a result, people gather evidence and recall information from memory selectively, and interpret it in a biased way.
The biases appear in particular for emotionally significant issues and for established beliefs.
I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that it is particularly prevalent in organisations when people feel that they are being told what to do i.</description>

      <description>My memory when it comes to remembering how to get text to and from Vim via the clipboard is pretty bad so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try summarising what I know and see if that works out any better.
We can access the system clipboard via the &amp;lsquo;+&amp;rsquo; buffer so the commands revolve around that.
To copy the whole file to the clipboard we can use this command:
:%y+ Or if we want to get the data between lines 4 and 10 then we could do:</description>

      <description>Irfanand I were looking at how to do some text substitution in a text file this afternoon and turned to sed to help us in our quest.
He had originally used grep to find what he wanted to replace on each line, using a grep regular expression to match one or more numbers:
cat the_file.txt | grep &amp;#34;[0-9]\+&amp;#34; That works pretty well but since I knew how to do the substitution in sed we needed to convert the regular expression to work with sed.</description>

      <description>We went to do some university recruitment recently and pairing with some of the students reminded me of some things that I&amp;rsquo;ve started doing better since I started working professionally.
I wanted to note them down so that I&amp;rsquo;m more aware that these might be common areas to improve on for university graduates that I work with in the future.
It seemed the same for the students I paired with and I therefore found it quite difficult to understand some of the code that they&amp;rsquo;d written.</description>

      <description>While trawling the comments of Dan North&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Deliberate Discovery&amp;rsquo; post I came across an interesting article written by Phillip G. Armour titled &amp;lsquo;The Five Orders of Ignorance&amp;rsquo;.
The main thing I took from the article is that the author uses the metaphor of software as a &amp;lsquo;knowledge acquisition activity&#39;for which he then defines five orders of ignorance that we can have in our attempts to acquire that knowledge.
These are as follows:</description>

This reminded me a lot of what I used to do when I came across things that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to do a few years ago.
I would write down the thing that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know and then make sure that I looked up the things on my list at the end of the day and then discuss what I&amp;rsquo;d read/learnt with a colleague the next day.</description>

      <description>I recently travelled to London and back for Christmas using Jet Airways and the whole journey got off to an &amp;lsquo;interesting&amp;rsquo; start.
I originally booked two Jet Airways flights - one from Pune to Delhi and another from Delhi to London.
A couple of weeks later I was sent an email cancelling my Pune to Delhi flight and informing me that I should contact their customer support centre.
I quickly browsed their website to check what had happened to my flight and found out that it had actually changed from being a Jet Airways flight and was now in fact a Jet Lite flight - their sister airline.</description>

      <description>Ashwinand I were recently discussing integration points in software systems and in particular how many systems are designed in such a way that they will stop the user from going any further if one of those integration points is down.
The main point in favour of designing systems in this way is that it&amp;rsquo;s logically very simple - all operations are synchronous and we don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about any offline processing.</description>

Yahuda Katz wrote a blog postearlier in the year where he listed some of the plugins he&amp;rsquo;s been using - one of which is called Command-Tand allows exactly this functionality.
I also quite like the ability to quickly access files that I&amp;rsquo;ve recently opened i.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading The Goalover the last week or so where Eliyahu Goldratt describes the theory of constraintsas a philosophy for allowing organisations to continually achieve their goal.
Goldratt goes on to describe bottlenecks- resources which have a capacity less than the capacity being demanded of the system.
The capacity of the system cannot be higher than that of the bottleneck which means that we need to find a way to optimise the bottlenecks in any system.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading some of the articles written about the disruption caused by the snow across Europe and I found one quote in The Daily Telegraphby Phillip Hammond particularly interesting
I was stuck in Brussels Airport for almost a day and the communication by just about everybody there was as non existent as it sounds like it&amp;rsquo;s been at Heathrow.
I think part of the reason for that was that the people in charge didn&amp;rsquo;t know what was happening and part of it was because they didn&amp;rsquo;t want to give people bad news.</description>

      <description>Some colleagues have been asking me recently what cultural differences I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed working in India compared to my experiences in the UK and Australia and one of the biggest differences by far is the amount of tolerance and patience people here have compared to me.
These attributes seem to show themselves in roughly two situations:
I was quite amazed to watch colleagues continuing with their conversations as if nothing had happened - I was totally distracted and had to go and sit in a meeting room away from the noise.</description>

      <description>Back in 2007/2008 when I worked on my first couple of projects at ThoughtWorks I always found it strange how frequently my colleagues would try and figure something out themselves rather than asking someone else (who already knew how to do it) how to do it.
Fast forward to 2010 and I find myself being the one encouraging people to figure things out themselves.
There&amp;rsquo;s still merit in communicating with colleagues when we&amp;rsquo;ve tried to work out how to do something and haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to figure it out but it&amp;rsquo;s also useful to not have this as our default mode.</description>

      <description>At a lot of organisations that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked there is a tendency to prioritise bugs by a priority bucket.
We might therefore have priority buckets 1-4 where the bucket number indicates how important the bug is to fix and then any buckets ranked below 4 would not be fixed but would be logged anyway.
From what I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed this isn&amp;rsquo;t a particularly effective way of managing bugs.
To start with there tend to be a lot of discussions around what the priority of each bug should be where a QA will argue that it should be a higher priority while a developer disagrees.</description>

It was really buzzing with noise and I thought it would be really fun to have the chance to work in that type of environment.</description>

      <description>A colleague and I ran into an interesting problem today which we wanted to use local port forwarding to solve.
In our environment.rb file we have a Solr instance url defined like so:
SOLR_CONFIG = { :service_url =&amp;gt; &amp;#34;http://some.internal.address:9983/solr/sco_slave_1&amp;#34; } It&amp;rsquo;s defined like that because our colleagues in Chicago have setup a Solr instance on a test environment and all the developers hit the same box.
In Pune everyone has Solr configured on their own box so we really wanted to configure that url to be &amp;lsquo;localhost&amp;rsquo; on port &amp;lsquo;8983&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Something which I&amp;rsquo;ve become fairly convinced about recently is that the environment that someone works in has far more impact on their perceived performance than their own individual skills.
Given that belief I&amp;rsquo;ve often got stuck answering why some people are better able to handle a difficult environment than others - in terms of accepting the situation and finding a way of being productive regardless.
Does this mean that they&amp;rsquo;re better than people who can&amp;rsquo;t work in that environment as effectively?</description>

My general thinking at the time I wrote that post was that sometimes it would be really difficult to find a way to learn anything on the project I was working on and the only way to learn would be to play around with something outside work.</description>

      <description>One of the cool things about software development is that despite writing code for 5 years professionally and just under 10 altogether, there are still a phenomenal number of things that I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to do.
The learning opportunities are vast!
One of the areas which I&amp;rsquo;ve known I don&amp;rsquo;t know that much about is Unix command line tools such as awk and sed.
Since the majority of projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on have involved using Windows as the development environment I&amp;rsquo;ve never had extended exposure to the types of problems we get on a project which require their use.</description>

Priyank uses GVim(Yehuda Katzrecommends MacVimif you&amp;rsquo;re using Mac OS) so we already don&amp;rsquo;t need to use the mouse at all when we&amp;rsquo;re inside the editor.
One annoying thing we found is that sometimes we wanted to copy stuff from the terminal into GVim and couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of a good way to do that without selecting the text on the terminal with a mouse and then &amp;lsquo;Ctrl-C&amp;rsquo;ing.</description>

      <description>My former colleague Greg Gigon has written an interesting blog post where he talks about the pain that we cause ourselves by multi-tasking, a point which Kevin Fox also makes on the Theory of Constraints blog.
I think the overall point that he makes is very true:
I&amp;rsquo;ve often found that when I try and switch between multiple different tasks I end up finishing none of them and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly true that twitter, facebook and emails can be amazingly distracting.</description>

      <description>In Continuous Deliverythe authors talk about the danger of ultimate configurability&amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip;and from my experience when you take this over configurability to its logical conclusion you end up developing a framework that can hopefully just be &amp;lsquo;configured&amp;rsquo; for any number of &amp;lsquo;front ends&amp;rsquo;.
This seems to be quite a common thing to do across organisations and typically the decision about what needs to go into the framework is made before there&amp;rsquo;s been much/any development on the applications which will make use of said framework.</description>

      <title>The fear tax</title>

      <description>Seth Godin recently wrote a post about &amp;lsquo;the fear tax&amp;rsquo; which he describes as a &amp;lsquo;tax&amp;rsquo; that we pay when we do something in order to try and calm our fear about something else but don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily end up calming those fears.
I think one common example of a time we fall into this trap when developing software is around the security of financial systems.
Due to legal requirements that firms operating in that domain operate under we can often end up with a very complicated security solution which is unnecessary for allowing us to achieve what we want to.</description>

      <description>Jonas Bonerrecently linked to a really cool (and short) presentation by John Cleese about creativitywhich I think is very applicable to software development.
Cleese describes some observations he&amp;rsquo;s made about creativity from his experiences working in comedy. These were some of the key ideas:
He was surprised to see that the rewritten version was actually an improvement over the original even though he&amp;rsquo;d written it much more quickly the second time and concludes that his unconscious mind must have still been working on the script even after he&amp;rsquo;d stopped writing it.</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time working through the first Micro Testing album of the Industrial Logic eLearning suitea few weeks ago and there&amp;rsquo;s an interesting piece of advice towards the end of the album:
Don&amp;rsquo;t let any technique or recommendation or rule of thumb become an excuse for not exercising your judgment.
While I think this is good advice I thought it was interesting that it seems to goes against the rules of thumbapproach that I described in a blog post towards the end of last year.</description>

      <description>Nikhiland I were discussing some of the ideas around Test Driven Development earlier in the week and at one stage I pointed out that I quite liked Bryan Liles&amp;rsquo; idea of &amp;lsquo;make it pass or change the message&amp;rsquo;.
Bryan suggests that when we have a failing test our next step should be to make that test pass or at least write some code which results in us getting a different error message and hopefully one step closer to making the test pass.</description>

      <description>One of the more interesting presentations doing the rounds on twitter and on our internal mailing lists is the following one by Dan Pink titled &amp;lsquo;Drive - The surprising truth about what motivates us&amp;rsquo;.
This topic generally interests me anyway but it&amp;rsquo;s quite intriguing that the research Dan has gathered support for what I imagine many people intrinsically knew.
The presentation dispels the myth that money always works as a motivator for getting people to do what we want them to do.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago Dermot and I showcased a piece of functionality that we&amp;rsquo;d been working on - notably hiding some options in a drop down list.
We showcased this piece of functionality to the rest of the team in Firefox and it all worked correctly.
Our business analyst, who was also acting as QA, then had a look at the story in Internet Explorer 6 and we promptly realised that the way we&amp;rsquo;d solved the problem didn&amp;rsquo;t actually work in IE6.</description>

      <description>On the project that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on over the past few months one of the key benefits of the application was its ability to perform various calculations based on user input.
In order to check that these calculators are producing the correct outputs we created a series of acceptance tests that ran directly against one of the objects in the system.
We did this by defining the inputs and expected outputs for each scenario in an excel spreadsheet which we converted into a CSV file before reading that into an NUnit test.</description>

      <description>I recently watched a presentation given by Joshua Kerievsky from the Lean Software &amp;amp; Systems conference titled &amp;lsquo;The Limited Red Society&amp;rsquo; in which describes an approach to refactoring where we try to minimise the amount of time that the code is in a &amp;lsquo;red&amp;rsquo; state.
This means that the code should be compiling and the tests green for as much of this time as possible .
I think it&amp;rsquo;s very important to follow these principles in order to successfully refactor code on a project team and it&amp;rsquo;s an approach that my colleague Dave Cameronfirst introduced me to when we worked together last year.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written previously about the Mikado method and how I&amp;rsquo;ve made use of it for identifying ways in which I could refactor codebut I think this approach is more generally applicable for any kind of code investigation.
Our application has a lot of calculations in it and we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to refactor the code which wires all the calculators up to make use of a DSL which reveals the intention of the code more as well as making it easier to test.</description>

      <description>Something which Dermot, Christianand I noticed last week is that on our project we&amp;rsquo;ve reached the stage where we intuitively know what the underlying problem is for any given error message in the application we&amp;rsquo;re working on.
We&amp;rsquo;re pretty much at the stage where we&amp;rsquo;re effectively pattern matching what&amp;rsquo;s going on without needing to think that much anymore.
This is a good thing because it saves a lot of time analysing every single message to try and work out what&amp;rsquo;s going on - I think this means that we&amp;rsquo;ve reached a higher level of the Dreyfus modelwhen it comes to this particular situation.</description>

      <description>Ken Schwaber recently wrote a blog post where he compared the differences between the kanban, lean and scrum approaches to software developmentand although I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the same experiences as he has with the first two, one interesting thing he implies is that with a scrum approach we have slack time built in.
The project that I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on has switched emphasis from being in pure delivery mode into a combination of delivery and handover and it&amp;rsquo;s been quite noticeable how much more slack we have in the system as a result.</description>

      <description>I gave a presentation at our ThoughtWorks Brazil office in Porto Alegre last way on some of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while working at ThoughtWorks and the first point I made was that it was better to &amp;lsquo;ask for forgiveness, not for permission&amp;rsquo;.
This was something that was taught to me a few years ago and the idea behind this is that if there&amp;rsquo;s some idea we want to try out it makes much more sense to start trying it now and then we can always apologise later on if someone has a problem with us doing that.</description>

      <description>Phil wrote an interesting post recently about the Ubuntu decision making process with respect to designand suggested that we should look to follow something similar on agile software development teams.
The Ubuntu design process basically comes down to this:
Phil suggests the following:
What that means is that, every time a design decision has to be made, the decision must come from an individual or very small group of people that have the skills and experience required –excluding coaching and teaching, of course.</description>

I initially felt that this would be a problem but the code was still pretty easy to changeand everyone on the team was able to understand it without any problem so that seemed to outweigh any other concerns.</description>

      <description>As part of our continuous integration build we have a step in the build which tears down a Windows service, uninstalls it and then reinstalls it later on from the latest files checked into the repository.
One problem we&amp;rsquo;ve been having recently is that despite the fact it should already have been uninstalled a lock has been kept on the log4net dll in our build directory, a directory that we tear down as one of the next steps.</description>

Neal defines these terms like so:
I find it interesting to consider where the line is for when something becomes essential complexity and when it&amp;rsquo;s accidental complexity although Neal suggests that there&amp;rsquo;s a spectrum between these two definitions upon which a piece of complexity sit.</description>

Having said that there are often features which require both front end and backend collaboration and we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to drive these features from the front end through to the backend rather than working on the backend code separately and then working with Les later on to hook it all up to the frontend.</description>

      <description>Alan Atlas has a recent blog post where he discusses agile, lean and scrum and suggests that you can&amp;rsquo;t truly achieve agility unless your company is fully committed to itwhich differs slightly from my experiences.
Alan makes a valid point that we&amp;rsquo;re not really following an approach just because we use all the practices:
It&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to put our work up on a story wall, run a daily standupand unit test our codeand not really get the full benefit that those practices are supposed to give us.</description>

These are some of my favourite parts:
Often on projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on we&amp;rsquo;ve taken the approach that bugs get worked on before new stories which makes sense in a way because it means that we are fixing problems quickly and keeping the quality of the application high.</description>

The idea with outside in development as I understand it is that we would look to drive any new functionality from the UI i.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m reading through Paul Butcher&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Debug It&amp;rsquo; book and one of his suggestions when trying to diagnose a problem in our code is to only change one thing at a time.
In a way this might seem fairly obvious but I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly fallen into the trap of making multiple changes at the same time in the misled belief that it&amp;rsquo;ll lead to the problem being solved more quickly.
When making changes to code Butcher has the following piece of advice which I quite like:</description>

      <description>Another paper that I read on my Sydney to London flight was one titled &amp;lsquo;You and Your Research&amp;rsquo; by Richard Hamming.
It&amp;rsquo;s a transcript of a talk that Richard Hamming gave to Bellcore employees at the Morris Research and Engineering Centre in 1986.
The talk is aimed at computer science researchers and Hamming describes ways for them to do the best research that they can. I think several of the ideas in the talk relate to software development as well.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a coupleof postsrecently talking about the gender specificness of the term &amp;lsquo;Software Craftsman&amp;rsquo; and Victoria suggests that the term &amp;lsquo;Codesmith&amp;rsquo; would be a more appropriate name to use.
I&amp;rsquo;m not that bothered what the name is but I was reading the transcript of Fred Brooks&amp;rsquo; acceptance speech for winning the ACM Allen Newell Award in 1994 titled &amp;lsquo;The Computer Scientist as Toolsmith&amp;rsquo; which has some interesting ideas about what our role should be.</description>

      <description>Oredevhave put some of the videos from the conference on Vimeoand one of my favourites is &amp;lsquo;Our obsession with efficiency&amp;rsquo; by my colleague Dan North.
The slides for the talk are available on SlideShare.
In this talk Dan leads from the following statement about efficiency:
In lean terms we want to look to favour the big picture over local optimisationswhereby we start to measure our effectiveness rather than efficiency. i.e. we focus on the results rather than the effort.</description>

      <description>Alongside taking a break from itperhaps one of the most effective ways to solve a tricky problem is to describe it to someone else.
This typically isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem when pair programming although it can still happen if a pair stays together too long and both start making the same possibly incorrect assumptions when trying to solve a problem.
In this case it makes sense to call someone else over who can lend a fresh perspective to the problem.</description>

      <description>Amongst the many posts written recently about unit testing one which I quite liked was written by fallenroguewhere he describes how in different contexts/cultures a different approach is favoured which means a technique like TDD might not work so well.
cashto, the guy who wrote the original post, agrees with this in the comments on that post:
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve started noticing that it&amp;rsquo;s quite beneficial to consider the contextthat we&amp;rsquo;re working in for all sorts of approaches we might want to take.</description>

      <description>It strikes me that one of the most important skills to develop in software development is knowing when to keep going with an approach to a problem and when we should stop and try something else.
This situation doesn&amp;rsquo;t always happen because if we have two people available and realise before we start on the task that there is some doubt as to which solution is the most appropriate then we can adopt a set based approachwhereby we try out multiple potential solutions in parallel.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve read quite frequently about the challenges we will experience when adding new people onto teams, including Fred Brooks&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;The Mythical Man Month&amp;rsquo;, but having seen quite a few new people join the project that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on over the last few months I think there are actually some significant benefits they can provide.
I think the impact new people provide is particularly useful on a challenging projectwhere they may be able to have a much more immediate impact.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a interview with Dave Hooverwhere he talks through the idea of working as an apprentice software developer and suggests some ways to do this more effectively.
I think the easiest thing to get wrong in software development is to over estimate our ability and there is even a study that proves that theory. Hoover refers to this as &amp;lsquo;having an accurate self assessment&amp;rsquo;.
If we work on the same project for a while then we&amp;rsquo;re going to get pretty good at navigating that code base and we&amp;rsquo;ll probably be able to solve any problem and add any piece of functionality fairly easily which only helps fuel the belief.</description>

      <description>Just over a year ago I wrote a blog post about my software development journey up to that pointand I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be interesting to write a new version for the 13 months or so since then to see what the main things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned are.
I&amp;rsquo;ve only really scratched the surface of what there is to know about functional programming so far but some of the ideas that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across seem very intriguing and I think they can help us to write more expressive and easier to understand code.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a post by Ayende where he talks about the need for tests to justify themselvesand describes his approach to testing which doesn&amp;rsquo;t involved TDDing all the code he writes.
While this approach clearly works well for Ayende I really like the following comment by Alex Simkin:
This reminds me of a conversation I was having with a few colleagues a while ago where we were discussing whether we should look to test drive absolutely everything that we write or whether we should make that decision on a case by case basis.</description>

      <description>I just came across quite an insightful post by Jak Charlton titled &amp;lsquo;Ship it or Ship out&amp;rsquo; in which he talks about the importance of shipping the software we work on, referring to Joel&amp;rsquo;s recent post &amp;lsquo;The Duct Tape Programmer&amp;rsquo;.
When I first read Joel&amp;rsquo;s post I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like it because it seems to downplay the role of unit testing when coding, something which I believe is quite important from my experience of software development so far.</description>

      <description>Recently my pair and I were trying to merge some changes into our code that we had just picked up fron updating from the trunk and realised that we weren&amp;rsquo;t actually sure how to resolve that merge since it seemed to conflict with what we&amp;rsquo;d been working on.
We hadn&amp;rsquo;t checked in for longer than we would have liked to due to a bit of a checkin pile up which had happened because the build on the CI server had been failing for a few hours due to a temporary problem we were having with an external dependency.</description>

      <description>One of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed over the past few years of working on software delivery projects is that the most challenging projects, the ones that most people hate working on, tend to last the longest yet teach you the most although maybe not immediately.
The problem is that a lot of the time we are in a state of frustration with all the things that are wrong about the project and therefore don&amp;rsquo;t focus on the things that we can do to make our situation better and improve the chances of the project to deliver.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a blog post by Seth Godin where he coins the term &amp;lsquo;bear shaving&#39;which is where we address the symptoms of a problem instead of addressing the problem.
The main example he gives is the idea of shaving a bearso that it can deal with the increased temperature caused by global warming instead of addressing the underlying problem which has led to this happening in the first place.</description>

Right now I find myself in favour of Jeremy&amp;rsquo;s approach which is more about writing some code and then getting some feedback on it and then writing some more code instead of spending a lot of time thinking before we write any code.</description>

      <description>I find one of the most applicable mantras in software development is Bob Sutton&amp;rsquo;s idea that we should have strong opinions weakly held.
The idea as I understand it is that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t sit on the fence but instead have an opinion that we research thoroughly and are prepared to back up. However, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t become too attached to those opinions but instead be prepared to listen to alternative points of view and take those on where they prove more useful than our previous opinions.</description>

      <description>One of the things I remember picking up from reading The Pragmatic Programmeris that developers need to be lazy in order to find better ways to solve problems and I came across a post by Philipp Lensson from a few years ago where he also suggests good developers are lazy and dumb.
Something which I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realise more recently is that it&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily true that being lazy as a developer is always a good thing - it depends in what way you are being lazy because there are certainly good and bad ways in which you can express your laziness!</description>

It was roughly based around a CI Maturity Modelwhich I recently came across although the intention was to find out what other teams were doing CI wise.
I became a bit more aware of how little I know about CI after listening to a Software Engineering Radio interview with my colleague Chris Readso I was keen to see how other teams are approaching this problem.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been using Fiddlerto debug the requests and responses sent via web services to a service layer our application interacts with and it works pretty well when you run the application using Cassinibut by default won&amp;rsquo;t work when you run the website through IIS.
The key to this as one of my colleagues (who gives credit to Erik) showed me today is to ensure that IIS is running under the same user that Fiddler is running under which in our case is the &amp;lsquo;Administrator&amp;rsquo; account.</description>

      <description>I pick up Michael Feathers&amp;rsquo; Working Effectively with Legacy Codebook from time to time and one of my favourite parts of the book is the chapter where he talks about &amp;lsquo;Seams&amp;rsquo;.
To quote the book:
Seams in the book are generally discussed in terms of how we can get tests around legacy code which was written without easy testability in mind but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that the ideas behind seams seem to be more widely applicable than this.</description>

      <description>Pat Kua has a recent post where he talks about the language used between testers and developerswhen talking about defects that testers come across when testing some functionality and while I would agree with him that the language used is important, I&amp;rsquo;ve always found that injecting some humour into the situation takes the edge off.
As Dahlia points out I think this is probably only possible if there is good rapport between the developers and testers on the teamso perhaps this has been the case for the teams I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on.</description>

The slides for the talk are hereand it&amp;rsquo;s also available on InfoQ.
To begin with it was a case of SOA gone bad with clients heavily coupled to services via WSDL definitions, a lot of code duplication, a complex/flaky architecture featuring a non standard JBoss and a team where the developers worked in silos.</description>

      <description>One interesting situation that we often arrive at when writing code is working out when the best time to apply a level of abstraction is.
I think there is always a trade offto be made when it comes to creating abstractions - creating the abstraction adds to the complexity of the code we&amp;rsquo;re writing but it is often the case that creating it makes it easier for us to navigate the code base.</description>

      <description>An interesting thing that I&amp;rsquo;ve started to notice recently with regards to software development books is that I get a lot more from reading the book the second time compared to what I did reading the book the first time.
I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed this for several books, including The Pragmatic Programmer, Code Completeand Domain Driven Design, so my first thought was that perhaps I had read this books too early when I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the necessary context or experience to gain value from reading them.</description>

      <description>As we know with software development with pretty much every decision we make or technology we choose there is a trade off that goes with making this choice as compared with choosing an alternative.
I first learnt this when working with Adea couple of years ago and while I know it to be true, I had come to believe that some practices are just non-negotiable and we should look to apply them judiciously wherever possible.</description>

      <title>Encoding user entered data</title>

      <description>I previously wrote about protecting websites from cross site scripting in the ASP.NET MVC frameworkby encoding user input when we are going to display it in the browser.
We can either choose to encode data like this or we can encode it straight away when we get it.
There did not seem to be a consensus on the best approach in a discussion on the ASP.NET forumsbut we believe it is far better to encode the data when it is outgoing rather than incoming.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading the transcript of Joel Spolsky/Jeff Atwood&amp;rsquo;s podcast discussion on TDD/Qualityand related posts on the subject by UncleBoband Ron Jeffriesand while I guess it&amp;rsquo;s fairly inevitable that I&amp;rsquo;m likely to side with the latter two, what I&amp;rsquo;ve realised is that I get the greatest enjoyment from my job when we are writing high quality software.
Certainly delivering value to customers in a timely manner is important but if we&amp;rsquo;re not producing something that we&amp;rsquo;re proud to have written then I think we&amp;rsquo;re doing ourselves and our customer a disservice.</description>

      <title>Finding the value in fixing technical debt</title>

      <description>Technical debtis a term coined by Martin Fowler which we tend to use on our projects to describe a number of different situations on projects as Ian Cartwright points outin his post on the subject.
Ian covers it in more detail, but to summarise my understanding of what technical debt actually is:
The latter part of the sentence is interesting because it is somewhat subjective. There are clearly different levels of what &amp;lsquo;affect us&amp;rsquo; means.</description>

      <description>Another of the ideas I have picked up from my leanreadingis that of trying things out without understanding exactly what is happening.
Or as The Toyota Way puts it&amp;hellip;
This is an approach which several colleagues I have worked with recently have been encouraging me to follow.
I am generally quite inquisitive and want to understand why something works as well as actually getting it to work, and while I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to encourage not reading the manual, taking this approach is sometimes less effective because it slows down our feedback cycle and, particularly when pairing, can be a less effective way of getting to a solution.</description>

      <title>Twitter as a learning tool</title>

      <description>About 8 or 9 months ago I remember having a conversation with a colleague where I asked him where he had got his almost encyclopedic knowledge of all things software development.
His reply at the time was that he read a lot of blogs and that this was where he had picked up a lot of the information.
While subscribing to different blogs remains a useful way of learning about different aspects of software development, I think Twitteris now becoming a very useful complementary tool to use alongside the RSS reader.</description>

      <title>jQuery Validation &amp; Firefox Refresh Behaviour</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been working quite a bit with jQueryand cross browser compatibility and one of the interesting differences we came across today was the behaviour of Firefox and Internet Explorer when it comes to refreshing a page.
When you press refresh in Internet Explorer the page gets refreshed to the state that it was in when you first loaded the URL, meaning that the state of the data in forms is returned to its original state.</description>

      <title>File system equivalent of commenting code</title>

      <description>Last week I came across what I have decided is the file system equivalent of commenting out code - not deleting directories when we are no longer using them.
The specific situation we ran into was while trying to make some Tomcat configuration changes but everything we changed was having no effect on what we were seeing on the web site.
Eventually we realised that we were actually changing the configuration in the wrong place - we actually had two Tomcat folder lying around.</description>

      <description>One of the very common pitfalls I make when working on things is to get so engrossed in the technical details of the problem that I completely forget the reason for doing it in the first place.
Over the last week or so I have noticed myself trying to solve some ridiculous problems without considering whether I am solving the right problem in the first place.
To give an example, I was working with Hibernate earlier in the week trying to setup a new mapping between two entities which involved creating a composite key on one of the entities, which led to us having to work out how to do that on the database, then editing our migration script, then trawling Google to work out why our mapping wasn&amp;rsquo;t working, before a colleague overheard our pain and pointed out that we had over complicated matters.</description>

      <description>In the comments of my previous post about my bad experiences with Java&amp;rsquo;s import staticmy colleague Carlosand several others pointed out that it is actually a useful feature when used properly.
The code base where I initially came across the feature misused it quite severely but it got me thinking about other language features I have come across which can add great value when used effectively but lead to horrific problems when misused.</description>

      <description>While reading some of the rough drafts of Apprenticeship Patternsonline I started thinking about the stages I have gone through on my Software Development journey so far.
I have worked in the industry for just over 3 years; 1 year at Reed Businessand 2 years at ThoughtWorks. Over that time my thoughts, opinions and ways of doing things have changed, and no doubt these will continue to evolve as I learn more and more.</description>

      <title>Handling balances in systems</title>

      <description>On one of my previous projects one of the problems that we had to solve was how to handle balances - we were working on a cash service for a financial services company.
The main discussion often centres around how often the balance should be updated. From my experience there are two main ways that we can go about this:
This is perhaps the most obvious approach and the implementation is fairly simple.</description>

      <title>From Prototype to Delivery</title>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2008/08/18/from-prototype-to-delivery/</guid>
      <description>Projects often reach the interesting point where the prototyping and development phases intersect and there are some interesting decisions to make.
From a development point of view the biggest decision is what to do with the code that has been developed.
When developing prototypesthe focus tends to be on getting something to work quick and dirty. Not a lot of time is put into considering edge cases or error conditions or any of the other niceties that are needed for software to be usable in an enterprise environment.</description>

      <description>When pair programmingthere are obviously times when you have different opinions about how things should be done.
One of these is the way that we should return from methods. There seem to be two approaches when it comes to this:
The Guard Blockis the best example of this. It is generally used at the start of methods to stop further execution of the method if the parameters are invalid for example:</description>

      <description>I am a big fan of Pat Kua&amp;rsquo;s tiny tasksand to see my desk would be to believe that there had been an invasion of yellow stickies on the planet.
Pat explains the idea on his website but to summarise; the idea is that given a story, you break it down into the individual tasks that need to be done in order for it to be complete, write each tasks on a sticky and then when that task is finished throw the sticky away.</description>

      <title>Pair Programming: The Non Driving Pair</title>

      <description>One of the intriguing aspects of pair programming for me is that of the non driving person in the pair – what are they supposed to do?!
Obviously there are fairly well known strategies for more interactive pairing, such as Ping Pongand Ball and Board (which is where one person controls the mouse and the other the keyboard), but neither of these strategies suggest what to do when you are not driving</description>
