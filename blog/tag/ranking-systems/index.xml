      <description>A few weeks ago I wrote about ranking Champions League teams using the Elo Rating algorithm, and since I wrote that post I&amp;#8217;ve collated data for 10 years worth of matches so I thought an update was in order.
 After extracting the details of all those matches I saved them to a JSON file so that I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have to parse the HTML pages every time I tweaked the algorithm.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in an earlier blog post I&amp;#8217;ve been learning about ranking systems and one of the first ones I came across was the Elo rating system which is most famously used to rank chess players.
 The Elo rating system uses the following formula to work out a player/team&amp;#8217;s ranking after they&amp;#8217;ve participated in a match:
  R&#39; = R + K * (S - E)
   R&#39; is the new rating</description>

      <description>I often go off on massive tangents reading all about a new topic but don&amp;#8217;t record what I&amp;#8217;ve read so if I go back to the topic again in the future I have to start from scratch which is quite frustrating.
 In this instance after playing around with calculating the eigenvector centrality of a sub graph I learnt that this algorithm can also be used in ranking systems.
 I started off by reading a paper written by James Keener about the Perron-Frobenius Theorem and the ranking of American football teams.</description>
