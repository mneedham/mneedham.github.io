      <description>As I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned previously I think the Kindle application on the iPad is the best one for reading books and as a result of that I wanted to be able to read some books which I&amp;#8217;d bought from the PragProg store onto it.
 The first step is to download the &#39;.mobi&#39; version of the book and use iPhoneExplorer to drag the file into the &#39;Kindle/Documents/eBook&#39; folder on the iPad.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a post I wrote last week I&amp;#8217;ve been writing a little iPad application to parse a cctray feed and then display the status of the various builds on the screen.
 The way I&amp;#8217;ve been doing this is by dynamically adding labels to the view and colouring the background of those labels red or green depending on the build status.

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve had the iPad for about a month now and since my colleagues Martin Fowler, Neal Ford and Chris Stevenson have already previously written about their experiences with it I thought I&amp;#8217;d share the way I&amp;#8217;m using it as well.
 Twitter I follow a lot of people involved in software development on twitter and come across a lot of interesting articles/blogs that people link to or write. A lot of the time I don&amp;#8217;t really want to read those posts when I come across them - it would be much better if I could just save them to read later on.</description>
