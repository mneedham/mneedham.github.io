      <description>Crystal Clearby Alistair CockburnThis was a book which had been recommended to me by a colleague a few months ago as one of the best software development books to read, and after hearing Ian Cooperdescribe how his team was implementing some of the ideas at the Alt.NET conferenceI decided I&amp;rsquo;d give it a read.
I have been working in an Agile/XP environment at ThoughtWorks for the last two years so my context coming into the book was around understanding where the overlap with Crystal Clear was, what differences there are and how I can apply these on my projects</description>
