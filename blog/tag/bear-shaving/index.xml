      <description>I recently came across a blog post by Seth Godin where he coins the term &amp;lsquo;bear shaving&amp;rsquo; which is where we address the symptoms of a problem instead of addressing the problem.
The main example he gives is the idea of shaving a bear so that it can deal with the increased temperature caused by global warming instead of addressing the underlying problem which has led to this happening in the first place.</description>
