      <description>I like using Wireshark to have a look at the traffic going across different interfaces but because it shows what&amp;rsquo;s happening across the wire by the packet it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult to tell what a request/response looked like.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with restfulie/Vraptor today so I wanted to be able to see the request/response pair when something wasn&amp;rsquo;t working.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it was actually possible but this post on StackOverflow describes how.</description>
