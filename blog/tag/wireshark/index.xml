      <description>I like using Wireshark to have a look at the traffic going across different interfaces but because it shows what&amp;#8217;s happening across the wire by the packet it&amp;#8217;s quite difficult to tell what a request/response looked like.
 I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with restfulie/http://vraptor.caelum.com.br/[Vraptor] today so I wanted to be able to see the request/response pair when something wasn&amp;#8217;t working.
 I didn&amp;#8217;t know it was actually possible but this post on StackOverflow describes how.</description>
