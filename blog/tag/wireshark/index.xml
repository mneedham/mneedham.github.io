      <description>I like using Wireshark to have a look at the traffic going across different interfaces but because it shows what’s happening across the wire by the packet it’s quite difficult to tell what a request/response looked like.
I’ve been playing around with restfulie/http://vraptor.caelum.com.br/[Vraptor] today so I wanted to be able to see the request/response pair when something wasn’t working.
I didn’t know it was actually possible but this post on StackOverflow describes how.</description>
