      <description>I’ve been complaining recently to Jen and Bruce about the lack of a beginner’s guide to emacs paredit mode which seems to be the defacto approach for people working with Clojure and both pointed me to the paredit cheat sheet.
While it’s very comprehensive, I found that it’s a little overwhelming for a complete newbie like myself.
I therefore thought it’d be useful to write a bit about a couple of things that I’ve picked up from pairing with Jen on little bits of Clojure over the last couple of months.</description>
