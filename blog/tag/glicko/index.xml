      <description>A couple of weeks ago I wrote about the Elo Rating system and when reading more about it I learnt that one of its weaknesses is that it doesn’t take into account the reliability of a players&amp;#39; rating.
For example, a player may not have played for a long time. When they next play a match we shouldn’t assume that the accuracy of that rating is the same as for another player with the same rating but who plays regularly.</description>
