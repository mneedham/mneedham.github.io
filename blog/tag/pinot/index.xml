      <description>In this post we&amp;#8217;ll learn how to deal with a field that contains DateTime strings when importing a CSV file into Apache Pinot. We&amp;#8217;ll also cover some of the error messages that you&amp;#8217;ll see if you do it the wrong way.

      <description>In Neha Pawar&amp;#8217;s recent blog post, What Makes Apache Pinot fast?, she summarises it with the following sentence:
  At the heart of the system, Pinot is a columnar store with several smart optimizations that can be applied at various stages of the query by the different Pinot components. Some of the most commonly used and impactful optimizations are data partitioning strategies, segment assignment strategies, smart query routing techniques, a rich set of indexes for filter optimizations, and aggregation optimization techniques.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with one of my favourite datasets from the Chicago Data Portal and spent a while figuring out how to import columns that contain spaces into Apache Pinot. In this blog post we&amp;#8217;ll learn how to do that using a subset of the data.

      <description>In my continued exploration of Apache Pinot, I wanted to spin up all the components individually rather than relying on one of the QuickStarts that takes care of that for me. In doing so I came across an interesting error that we&amp;#8217;ll explore in this post.

      <description>In my continued exploration of Apache Pinot I&amp;#8217;ve been trying out the GitHub events recipe , which imports data from the GitHub events stream into Pinot. In this blog post I want to show how I worked around an exception I was getting when trying to filter the data by one of the timestamp&amp;#8217;s column.

      <description>As I mentioned in my last blog post, I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with Apache Pinot, a data store that&amp;#8217;s optimised for user facing analytical workloads.
   My understanding is that Pinot is a really good fit for datasets where:
  The query patterns are of an analytical nature e.g. slicing and dicing on any columns.
  We&amp;#8217;re ingesting the data in real time from a stream of events.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently been playing around with Apache Pinot, a realtime analytical data store that&amp;#8217;s used for user facing analytics use cases. In this blog post I want to walk through some challenges I had connecting to Pinot using the Python driver and how I got things working.
 I&amp;#8217;m running Pinot locally using the Docker image, which I setup in a Docker compose file:
 docker-compose.yml version: &#39;3.7&#39; services: pinot: image: apachepinot/pinot:0.</description>
