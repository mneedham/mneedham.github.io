      <description>A few years ago before an F# talk that I gave at the .NET user group in Sydney my colleague Erik Doernenburg gave me some advice about how I should structure the talk.
(paraphrasing)If two people give a talk on the same topic they therefore end up being fairly similar talks even though each person may have a totally different perspective.
Erik suggested that people would find it much more interesting if I told a story about what I&amp;rsquo;d learnt about my topic (in this case F#).</description>

      <description>I recently came across a really cool blog post by Dr Nic titled &amp;lsquo;How to stop killing people with your public speeches&amp;rsquo; where he talks about the importance of practicing our presentations so that they actually make an impact on our audience.
Towards the end of the post he suggests joining Toastmastersas a useful first step for getting used to speaking to a group of people and as an added bonus you get feedback after each speech you give.</description>
