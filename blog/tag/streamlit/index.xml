      <description>I recently came across Streamlit, a tool that makes it easy to build data based single page web applications. I wanted to give it a try, and the UK Charts QuickGraph that I recently wrote about seemed like a good opportunity for that.
 This blog post starts from where we left off. The data is loaded into Neo4j and we&amp;#8217;ve written some queries to explore different aspects of the dataset.</description>
