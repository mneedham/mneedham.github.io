      <description>Something which an agile approach on a project typically gives us is the ability to change requirements rapidly based on the different types of feedback we typically get over the course of the project.
One way that we can lose this advantage is by getting caught up by the number of story points being completed and using this as the measure of success.
The flexibility to change has an impact on the number of story points that may be completed in a given iteration - if we start doing some work on a story and then get feedback from the business while it is still in progress itâ€™s possible that we will end up with more work to do than we had previously.</description>
