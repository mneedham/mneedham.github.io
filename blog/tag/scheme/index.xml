      <description>One of the awesome things about working with clojure is that it’s possible to wire up clojure files in emacs to a REPL by making use of Slime/https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure[Swank].
I’ve started using Racket to work through the examples in The Little Schemer and wanted to achieve a similar thing there.
Racket is a modern programming language in the Lisp/Scheme family, suitable for a wide range of applications
I don’t know much about configuring emacs so I made use of Phil Halgelberg’s emacs-starter-kit which is available on github.</description>
