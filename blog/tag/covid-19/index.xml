      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been several months since our last QuickGraph and the world feels very different than it was back then. I&amp;#8217;ve been reading a couple of books about viruses - Spillover and Pale Rider - and am now very curious to learn more about the medical terms reference in the books.
 With the Pre Release of neosemantics (n10s) for Neo4j 4.0, I thought it would be interesting to create a graph of the taxonomy of the virus that caused COVID-19, using data extracted from Wikidata&amp;#8217;s SPARQL API.</description>
