      <description>Over the last 13 months I&amp;#8217;ve spent countless hours looking at dashboards that showed Coronavirus infection rates, death rates, and numbers of people vaccinated. The UK government host a dashboard at coronavirus.data.gov.uk, which contains charts and tables showing all of the above.
 One thing I haven&amp;#8217;t been able to find, however, is a drill down of vaccinations by local area and age group. So I&amp;#8217;m going to try to build my own!</description>

      <description>One of the Altair charts on my Covid Vaccine Dashboards Streamlit app shows the % of first doses, but when I first created it there was some padding on the X axis that I wanted to remove. In this blog post we&amp;#8217;ll learn how to do that.
 Pre requisites Let&amp;#8217;s start by installing the following libraries:
 pip install pandas altair altair_viewer   Next let&amp;#8217;s import them, as shown below:</description>

      <description>In my continued experiments with the Altair visualisation library, I wanted to set a custom range of data values on the x axis of a chart. In this blog post we&amp;#8217;ll learn how to do that.
 We&amp;#8217;ll start where we left off in the last blog post, with the following code that renders a scatterplot containing the chart position of a song on a certain date:
 import altair as alt import pandas as pd import datetime df = pd.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing with the Altair statistical visualisation library and recently ran into an error while trying to render a DataFrame that contained dates.
 I was trying to render a scatterplot containing the chart position of a song on a certain date, as seen in the code below:
 # pip install altair pandas import altair as alt import pandas as pd import datetime df = pd.DataFrame( [ {&#34;position&#34;: 2, &#34;</description>
