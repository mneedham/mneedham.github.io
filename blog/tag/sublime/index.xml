      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using Sublime a bit recently and one thing I wanted to do was put neo4j cypher queries into files with arbitrary extensions and have them recognised as cypher files every time I open them.
 I&amp;#8217;m using the cypher Sublime plugin to get the syntax highlighting but since I&amp;#8217;ve got my cypher in a .haml file it only remembers that it should have cypher highlighting as long as the file is open.</description>

      <description>After coming across this post about why you should use Sublime Text I decided to try using it a bit more and one of the things that I missed from Textmate was the way you can select the current file on the sidebar.
 In Textmate the shortcut to do that is &#39;Cmd + Ctrl + R&#39; so I wanted to be able to do something similar or configure Sublime so it responded to the same shortcut.</description>
