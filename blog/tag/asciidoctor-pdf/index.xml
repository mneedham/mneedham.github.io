      <description>I’ve been using asciidoctor-pdf to generate PDF and while I was initially running the tool locally I eventually decided to setup a build on TeamCity.
It was a bit trickier than I expected, mostly because I’m not that familiar with deploying Ruby applications, but I thought I’d capture what I’ve done for future me.
I have the following Gemfile that installs asciidoctor-pdf and its dependencies:
Gemfile
source &amp;#39;https://rubygems.org&amp;#39; gem &amp;#39;prawn&amp;#39; gem &amp;#39;addressable&amp;#39; gem &amp;#39;prawn-svg&amp;#39; gem &amp;#39;prawn-templates&amp;#39; gem &amp;#39;asciidoctor-pdf&amp;#39; I don’t have permissions to install gems globally on the build agents so I’m bundling those up into the vendor directory.</description>
