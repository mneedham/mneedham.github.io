      <description>One of the things I dislike the most when coding is writing if statements. and while I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that if should be completely abolished from our toolkit, I think the anti if campaign started about a year ago is going along the right lines.
While there is certainly value in using an if statement as a guard block it usually feels that we have missed an abstraction if we are using it elsewhere.</description>
