      <description>Continuing with my attempts to test some of the code in my twitter application I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to work out how to test the Erlang style messaging which I set up to process tweets when I had captured them using the TweetSharp API.
The problem I had is that that processing is being done asynchronously so we can&amp;rsquo;t test it in our normal sequential way.
Chatting with Dave about this he suggested that what I really needed was a latch which could be triggered when the asynchronous behaviour had completed, thus informing the test that it could proceed.</description>
