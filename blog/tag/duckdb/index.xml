      <description>I was recently trying to convert a CSV file to Parquet format and came across a StackOverflow post that described a collection of different options. My CSV file was bigger than the amount of memory I had available, which ruled out some of the methods. In this blog post we’re going to walk through some options for exporting big CSV files to Parquet format.

      <description>I’ve been playing around with DuckDB, the new hotness in the analytics space, over the last month, and my friend Michael Hunger asked whether you could use it to compute a diff of Apache Parquet schemas.
Challenge accepted!
