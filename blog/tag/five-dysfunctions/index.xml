      <description>I recently came across an interesting post by my colleague Pat Kua where he talks about how some patterns he&amp;#8217;s noticed in code can be linked to Conway&amp;#8217;s law which suggests that the structure of systems designed in organisations will mirror the communication structure of that organisation.
 I recently read a book called &#39;http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2009/04/22/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-book-review/[The Five Dysfunctions of Teams]&#39; which describe some behaviours in teams which aren&amp;#8217;t working in an effective way.</description>
