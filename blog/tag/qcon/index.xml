      <description>The final Domain Driven Designtalk I attended at QConwas by Dan Bergh Johnssonabout the importance of value objects in our code.
I thought this session fitted in really well as a couple of the previous speakers had spoken of the under utilisation of value objects.
The slides for the presentation are here.</description>

      <description>Talk #3 on the Domain Driven Design trackat QConwas by Phil Willsabout how the Guardian rebuilt their website using Domain Driven Design.
I&amp;rsquo;d heard a little bit about this beforehand from colleagues who had the chance to work on that project but it seemed like a good opportunity to hear a practical example and the lessons learned along the way.
There are no slides available for this one on the QCon website at the moment.</description>

      <description>The second presentation in the Domain Driven Design trackat QConwas titled &amp;lsquo;DDD &amp;amp; BDD&amp;rsquo; and was presented by my colleague Dan North- a late stand in for Greg Young who apparently injured himself playing ice hockey.
Eric did an interview with Greg at QCon San Francisco 2007where Greg talks about some of his ideas and apparently there is an InfoQ video kicking around of Greg&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Unshackle Your Domain&amp;rsquo; talk from QCon San Francisco 2008 which we were told to pester InfoQ to post on their website!</description>

      <description>I went to the QCon conference in Londonon Thursday, spending the majority of the day on Eric Evans&amp;rsquo; Domain Driven Design track.
The opening presentation was by Eric Evans, himself, and was titled &amp;lsquo;What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about DDD since the book&amp;rsquo;.
We&amp;rsquo;re currently reading Domain Driven Designin our technical book club in the ThoughtWorks Sydney office so I was intrigued to hear about Eric&amp;rsquo;s experiences with DDD and how those compared with ours.</description>
