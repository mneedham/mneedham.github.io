      <description>At the Alt.NET UK Conferencewhich I attendedover the weekend it occurred to me while listening to some of the discussions on Domain Driven Designthat a lot of the ideas in DDD are actually very similar to those being practiced in Object Oriented Programmingand related best practices.
There was quite a bit of discussion in the session about anaemic domain models.
An anaemic domain model is one where a lot of the objects are merely data holders and do not actually have any behaviour inside them.</description>

      <description>I spent most of yesterday at the 2nd Alt.NET UKconference at Conway Hall in London.
First of all kudos to Ian Cooper, Alan Deanand Ben Hallfor arranging it. There seemed to be a lot more people around than for the one in February which no doubt took a lot of arranging.
It was again run using the open spacesformat and we started with an interesting discussion on what Alt.NET actually is.</description>
