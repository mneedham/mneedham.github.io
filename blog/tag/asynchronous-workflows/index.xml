      <description>I spent a bit of time over the weekend playing around with F# asynchronous workflows and seeing how they could be used to launch Firefox windows asynchronously for my FeedBurner graph creator.
Initially I decided to try out the &amp;#39;Async.RunWithContinuations&amp;#39; function which I recently read about on Matthew Podwysockiâ€™s blog.
Matthew describes this as being a function which is useful for executing a single operation asynchronously and this worked out quite well for me as my application only has the ability to get one feed and then create a graph from its data.</description>
