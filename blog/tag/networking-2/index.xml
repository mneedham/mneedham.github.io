      <description>Phil and I spent some of Friday afternoon configuring statsd:
 A network daemon that runs on the Node.js platform and listens for statistics, like counters and timers, sent over UDP and sends aggregates to one or more pluggable backend services  We configured it to listen on its default port 8125 and then used netcat to send UDP packets to see if it was working like so:
echo -n &amp;quot;blah:36|c&amp;quot; | nc -w 1 -u -4 localhost 8125  We used tcpdump to capture any UDP packets on port 8125 like so:</description>

We initially tried sending a UDP packet to localhost port 8125 using netcat like so:
echo -n &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; | nc -w 1 -u localhost 8125  That message wasn&amp;rsquo;t being received by the application listening on the port so Phil decided to try and send the same packet from Ruby which worked fine:</description>
