      <description>As part of a Go script I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on I wanted to write to a CSV file from multiple Go routines, but realised that the built in CSV Writer isn&amp;rsquo;t thread safe.
My first attempt at writing to the CSV file looked like this:
package main import ( &amp;quot;encoding/csv&amp;quot; &amp;quot;os&amp;quot; &amp;quot;log&amp;quot; &amp;quot;strconv&amp;quot; ) func main() { csvFile, err := os.Create(&amp;quot;/tmp/foo.csv&amp;quot;) if err != nil { log.Panic(err) } w := csv.</description>

      <description>As part of a recommendations with Neo4j talk that I&amp;rsquo;ve presented a few times over the last year I have a set of scripts that download some data from the meetup.com API.
They&amp;rsquo;re all written in Python but I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be a fun exercise to see what they&amp;rsquo;d look like in Go. My eventual goal is to try and parallelise the API calls.
This is the Python version of the script:</description>

      <description>In a previous blog post I mentioned that I wanted to extract blips from The ThoughtWorks Radar into a CSV file and I thought this would be a good mini project for me to practice using Go.  In particular I wanted to try using channels and this seemed like a good chance to do that. 
I watched a talk by Rob Pike on designing concurrent applications where he uses the following definition of concurrency:</description>

      <description>In an earlier blog post I mentioned that I&#39;d been building an internal application to learn a bit of Go and I wanted to deploy it to AWS. Since the application was only going to live for a couple of days I didn&#39;t want to spend a long time build up anything fancy so my plan was just to build the executable, SSH it to my AWS instance, and then run it.</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time over the last week building a little internal web application using Go and the Gin Web Framework and it took me a while to get the hang of the templating language so I thought I&#39;d write up some examples.  Before we get started, I&#39;ve got my GOPATH set to the following path: $ echo $GOPATH /Users/markneedham/projects/gocode  And the project containing the examples sits inside the src directory: $ pwd /Users/markneedham/projects/gocode/src/github.</description>
