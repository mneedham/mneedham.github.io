      <description>I started reading Kathy Sierra&#39;s new book &#39;Badass: Making users awesome&#39; a couple of weeks ago and with the gift of flights to/from Stockholm this week I&#39;ve got through the rest of it.  I really enjoyed the book and have found myself returning to it almost every day to check up exactly what was said on a particular topic.  There were a few things that I&#39;ve taken away and have been going on about to anyone who will listen.</description>

      <title>The Hard Thing About Hard Things - Ben Horowitz: Book Review</title>

      <description>I came across &#39;The Hard Thing About Hard Things&#39; while reading an article about Ben Horowitz&#39;s venture capital firm and it was intriguing enough that I bought it and then read through it over a couple of days.
Although the blurb suggests that it&#39;s a book about about building and running a startup I think a lot of the lessons are applicable for any business.
These were some of the main points that stood out for me:</description>

      <title>On Writing Well - William Zinsser: Book Review</title>
      <link>https://mneedham.github.io/blog/2013/09/30/on-writing-well-william-zinsser-book-review/</link>

      <guid>https://mneedham.github.io/blog/2013/09/30/on-writing-well-william-zinsser-book-review/</guid>
      <description>I first came across William Zinsser&#39;s &#39;On Writing Well&#39; about a year ago, but put it down having flicked through a couple of the chapters that I felt were relevant.
It came back onto my radar a month ago and this time I decided to read it cover to cover as I was sure there were some insights that I&#39;d missed due to my haphazard approach the first time around.</description>

      <description>The Book 9 algorithms that changed the future (the ingenious ideas that drive today&#39;s computers) by John MacCormick
My Thoughts I came across this book while idly browsing a book store and since I&#39;ve found most introduction to algorithms books very dry I thought it&#39;d be interesting to see what one aimed at the general public would be like.
Overall it was an enjoyable read and I quite like the pattern that the author used for each algorithm, which was:</description>

      <title>Book Review: The Signal and the Noise - Nate Silver</title>
      <link>https://mneedham.github.io/blog/2013/05/14/book-review-the-signal-and-the-noise-nate-silver/</link>

      <guid>https://mneedham.github.io/blog/2013/05/14/book-review-the-signal-and-the-noise-nate-silver/</guid>
      <description>Nate Silver is famous for having correctly predicted the winner of all 50 states in the 2012 United States elections and Sid recommended his book so I could learn more about statistics for the A/B tests that we were running.
I thought the book was a really good introduction to applied statistics and by using real life examples which most people would be able to relate to it makes a potentially dull subject interesting.</description>

      <title>Discussing the Undiscussable: Book Review</title>

      <description>I came across the work of Chris Argyris at the start of the year and in a twitter conversation with Benjamin Mitchell he suggested that Bill Noonan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Discussing the Undiscussable&amp;rsquo; was the most accessible text for someone new to the subject.
In the book Noonan runs through a series of different tools that Chris Argyris originally came up with for helping people to handle difficult conversational situations more effectively.
I really like the way the book is written.</description>

      <title>The Adventures of Johnny Bunko -  The Last Career Guide You&#39;ll Ever Need: Book Review</title>

      <description>I read Dan Pink&amp;rsquo;s A Whole New Mind earlier in the year but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard of The Adventures of Johnny Bunko until my colleague Sumeet Moghe mentioned it in a conversation during ThoughtWorks India&amp;rsquo;s XConf, an internal conference run here.
The book is written in the Manga format so it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly quick to read and it gives 6 ideas around building a career.
I&amp;rsquo;m generally not a fan of the idea of &amp;lsquo;building a career&amp;rsquo; - generally when I hear that phrase it involves having a &amp;lsquo;five year&amp;rsquo; plan and other such concepts which I consider to be pointless.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve read a couple of Seth Godin&amp;rsquo;s other books - Tribes and The Dip - and found them fairly readable so I figured his latest offering, Linchpin, would probably be worth a read too.
This is the first book that I&amp;rsquo;ve read on the iPad&amp;rsquo;s Kindle application and it was a reasonably good reading experience - I particularly like the fact that you can make notes and highlight certain parts of the text.</description>

      <description>My colleagues Frankie and Danilo have been recommending &amp;lsquo;Maverick&amp;rsquo; to me for a long time and I finally got around to reading it.
In this book Ricardo Semler, the CEO of Semco, tells the story of the company and how he helped evolved the organisation into one which is more employee led and embraces ideas such as open &amp;amp; self set salaries while encouraging civil obedience in the workforce as a necessity to alert the organisation to its problems.</description>

      <description>I recently watched Randy Pausch&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Last Lecture: Achieving Your Childhood Dreams&amp;rsquo; and read the corresponding book and although it&amp;rsquo;s not directly related to software development I think that some of the points that he makes are really intriguing.
These were some of the parts that particularly stood out for me:
 Introduce the elephant in the room - whatever it is that people are really thinking about, put it out in the open.</description>

      <description>David Agans&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Debugging&amp;rsquo; is the best debugging book that I&amp;rsquo;ve read so I was intrigued to see that there was another book being written on the subject.
Paul Butcher offered me a copy of the book to review so I was keen to see whether it was more like &amp;lsquo;Debugging&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Release It&amp;rsquo; as Ted Neward suggests.
The Book Debug It by Paul Butcher
The Review Much like Krzysztof Kozmic I found that a lot of the ideas early on in the book were similar to what I&amp;rsquo;ve been taught by my ThoughtWorks colleagues over the last 3 1&amp;frasl;2 years.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite recent blog posts is one written by Sammy Larbi on coupling and cohesion and while discussing it with Phil he suggested that I would probably like this book and in particular the chapter on connascence which I&amp;rsquo;ve previously written about.
The Book Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Design in UML by Meilir Page-Jones
The Review I really enjoyed reading this book and I think it&amp;rsquo;s one that I could come back and read again to gain something else from in the future.</description>

      <description>The Book Zen Mind, Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Mind by Shunryu Suzuki
The Review I first came across the actual term beginner&amp;rsquo;s mind when reading through the &amp;lsquo;Wear The White Belt&amp;rsquo; chapter of Apprenticeship Patterns although it was often mentioned to me on one of the first projects I did at ThoughtWorks a couple of years ago that people liked teaching me things because I just took the information in pretty much without questioning.</description>

      <description>The Book Brownfield Application Development in .NET by Kyle Baley and Donald Belcham
The Review I asked to be sent this book to review by Manning as I was quite intrigued to see how well it would complement Michael Feather&amp;rsquo;s Working Effectively with Legacy Code, the other book I&amp;rsquo;m aware of which covers approaches to dealing with non green field applications.
What did I learn?  The authors provide a brief description of the two different approaches to unit testing - state based and behaviour based - I&#39;m currently in favour of the latter approach and Martin Fowler has a well known article which covers pretty much anything you&#39;d want to know about this topic area.</description>

      <description>We restarted our book club again last week by reading James Noble&amp;rsquo;s Arguments and Results paper, a paper I came across from a Michael Feathers blog post a few months ago detailing 10 papers that every programmer should read.
We decided to try out the idea of reading papers/individual chapters from books as it allows us to vary the type of stuff we&amp;rsquo;re reading more frequently and is an approach which Obie seems to be having some success with.</description>

      <description>The Book Real World Functional Programming by Tomas Petricek with Jon Skeet (corresponding website)
The Review I decided to read this book after being somewhat inspired to learn more about functional programming after talking with Phil about his experiences learning Clojure. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on a .NET project so it seemed to make sense that F# was the language I picked to learn.
What did I learn?  I&#39;ve worked with C# 3.</description>

      <description>The Book The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni
The Review I heard about this book a while ago but I was intrigued to actually get a copy by Darren Cotterill, the Iteration Manager on the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on at the moment.
I was particularly interested in learning whether the ideas of agile and/or lean help to solve any of these dysfunctions.
What did I learn?  The book is split into two sections.</description>

      <description>An interesting thing that I&amp;rsquo;ve started to notice recently with regards to software development books is that I get a lot more from reading the book the second time compared to what I did reading the book the first time.
I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed this for several books, including The Pragmatic Programmer, Code Complete and Domain Driven Design, so my first thought was that perhaps I had read this books too early when I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the necessary context or experience to gain value from reading them.</description>

      <description>The Book Talent is Overrated by Geoff Colvin
The Review I came across this book on Jason Yip&amp;rsquo;s Twitter feed while the idea of 10,000 hours to become an expert at any given skill was being discussed. I&amp;rsquo;m reading Outliers as well and the two books seem to complement each other quite well.
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in how we can apply deliberate practice in software development, perhaps using the medium of coding dojos, to become better developers in a more effective manner than just normal practice.</description>

      <description>The Book Fearless Change by Mary Lyan Manns and Linda Rising
The Review I came across this book while watching an interview with Linda Rising on InfoQ. She mentioned some ideas from Malcolm Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s The Tipping Point which intrigued me and a strong recommendation from a colleague ensured this book made it onto my reading list.
I am not currently working on a project where I need to instigate a lot of change so I was going slightly against my own principle of only reading books when I need to, but I recalled several times previously when I have tried to introduce what I thought were good ideas and didn&amp;rsquo;t really get anywhere.</description>

      <description>The Book The Productive Programmer by Neal Ford The Review I first came across this book when I was browsing Andy Hunt&amp;rsquo;s Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware on Amazon. It showed up as one of the related books.
I had expected it to be a more theoretical book than it actually is. It is full of really useful command line tips and ways to use system tools and IDEs more effectively.</description>
