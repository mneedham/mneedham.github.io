      <description>A couple of years ago I wrote a blog post explaining how I&amp;#8217;d used GNU awk to extract story numbers from git commit messages and I wanted to do a similar thing today to extract some node ids from a file.
 My eventual solution looked like this:
 $ echo &#34;mark #1000&#34; | gawk &#39;{ match($0, /#([0-9]+)/, arr); if(arr[1] != &#34;&#34;) print arr[1] }&#39; 1000   But in the comments an alternative approach was suggested which used the Mac version of awk and the RSTART and RLENGTH global variables which get set when a match is found:</description>

      <description>We were doing some work last week to rasterize a PDF document into a sequence of images and wanted to get a rough idea of how many pages we&amp;#8217;d be dealing with if we created an image per page.
 The PDFs we&amp;#8217;re dealing with are linearized since they&amp;#8217;re available for viewing on the web:
  A LINEARIZED PDF FILE is one that has been organized in a special way to enable efÔ¨Åcient incremental access in a network environment.</description>
