      <description>Our latest technical book club session was a discussion of the logging section in Michael Nygard&amp;#8217;s Release It.
 I recently listened to an interview with Michael Nygard on Software Engineering Radio so I was interested in reading more of his stuff and Cam suggested that the logging chapter would be an interesting one to look at as it&amp;#8217;s often something which we don&amp;#8217;t spend a lot of time thinking about on software development teams.</description>
