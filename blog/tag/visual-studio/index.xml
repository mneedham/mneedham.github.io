      <description>We’ve recently run into some places in our tests where the expectation and actual values passed into NUnit&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Assert.AreEqual&amp;#39; are the wrong way round, therefore meaning that the error messages we get when tests fail are somewhat confusing!
Assert.AreEqual(theActualValue, &amp;#34;the expectation&amp;#34;); We can change the arguments around using Resharper by using the key combination &amp;#39;Ctrl-Alt-Shift-ArrowKey&amp;#39; but you can only do this one line at a time which was a bit annoying as there were about 20 to change.</description>

      <title>Resharper templates</title>

      <description>One of the first things that I do when I go onto a project is setup a ReSharper template for writing tests.
I generally set this up so that when I type &amp;#39;should&amp;#39; I can press tab and it will automatically create an outline of a test method for me.
Creating a template is as simple as going to &amp;#39;ReSharper &amp;gt; Live Templates&amp;#39; from Visual Studio.
I have attached several templates that I seem to end up writing over and over again.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite features of IntelliJ is that it tracks the item that you currently have open on your Solution Explorer.
I thought this wasn’t possible in Visual Studio and had resigned myself to trying to remember which project each file was in. Luckily for me a colleague pointed out that it is in fact possible but is just turned off by default.
