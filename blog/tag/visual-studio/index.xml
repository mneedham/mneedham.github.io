      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve recently run into some places in our tests where the expectation and actual values passed into NUnit&#39;s &#39;Assert.AreEqual&#39; are the wrong way round, therefore meaning that the error messages we get when tests fail are somewhat confusing!
 Assert.AreEqual(theActualValue, &#34;the expectation&#34;);   We can change the arguments around using Resharper by using the key combination &#39;Ctrl-Alt-Shift-ArrowKey&#39; but you can only do this one line at a time which was a bit annoying as there were about 20 to change.</description>

      <title>Resharper templates</title>

      <description>One of the first things that I do when I go onto a project is setup a ReSharper template for writing tests.
 I generally set this up so that when I type &#39;should&#39; I can press tab and it will automatically create an outline of a test method for me.
 Creating a template is as simple as going to &#39;ReSharper &amp;gt; Live Templates&#39; from Visual Studio.
 I have attached several templates that I seem to end up writing over and over again.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite features of IntelliJ is that it tracks the item that you currently have open on your Solution Explorer.
 I thought this wasn&amp;#8217;t possible in Visual Studio and had resigned myself to trying to remember which project each file was in. Luckily for me a colleague pointed out that it is in fact possible but is just turned off by default.
 Tools &amp;gt; Options &amp;gt; Projects and Solutions &amp;gt; Check &#39;Track Active Item in Solution Explorer&#39;</description>
