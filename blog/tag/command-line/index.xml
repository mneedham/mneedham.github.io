      <description>The way we have setup the build on our continuous integration server, Team City is configured to create a new tag every time the functional tests past successful on that machine.
We then have a QA and Showcase build that we can run to deploy all the artifacts necessary to launch the application on that machine.
Originally I had just written the batch script to take in the tag of the build which the user could find by looking through repo-browser for the last tag created.</description>

      <description>I mentioned in a couple of earlier posts that I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing quite a bit of work with batch files and the windows command line, and today I wanted to do an If Else statement in one of my scripts.
I thought it would be relatively simple, but after various searches and having read articles that suggested that there wasn&amp;rsquo;t an ELSE construct in batch land I finally found a forum post which explained how to do it.</description>
