      <description>The Mythical Man Monthby Fred Brooks Junior
Pretty much since I started working at ThoughtWorks 2 1/2 years ago I&amp;rsquo;ve been told that this is a book I have to read and I&amp;rsquo;ve finally got around to doing so.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not that surprising but my overriding thought about the book is that just about every mistake that we make in software development today is covered in this book!
In other words&amp;hellip;Domain Driven Design!</description>
