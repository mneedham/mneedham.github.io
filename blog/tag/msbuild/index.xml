      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been having trouble trying to work out how to build our projects in msbuild in release mode without creating the customary pdb files that seem to be created by default.
I tried calling msbuild.exe with the &amp;lsquo;Release&amp;rsquo; configuration:
&#39;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\MSBuild.Exe ( Proj.csproj /p:OutputPath=\output\path\ /p:Configuration=Release)&#39;  To no avail. It still created the pdb file. Next I tried setting the &amp;lsquo;DebugSymbols&amp;rsquo; property to false:
&#39;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\MSBuild.Exe ( Proj.csproj /p:OutputPath=\output\path\ /p:Configuration=Release /p:DebugSymbols=false)&#39;  Still it created the file.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been using msbuild to build our project files on my current project and a colleague and I noticed some strange behaviour when trying to set the directory that the output should be built to.
The problem was whenever we tried to set the output directory (using OutDir) to somewhere where there was a space in the directory name it would just fail catastrophically. We spent ages searching for the command line documentation before finding it here.</description>
