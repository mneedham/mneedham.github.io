      <description>One of the most important things to achieve if we are to get any sort of productivity when writing code is to find ways to get the quickest feedback possible.
 My general default stance with respect to this has always been to TDD code although I&amp;#8217;ve found when coding in F# that I&amp;#8217;m not actually sure what the overall best way to get quick feedback is.
 This is partly because I haven&amp;#8217;t been able to find a way to run tests easily from inside Visual Studio but also partly because even when you do this the code for the whole project needs to be recompiled before the tests can be run which takes time.</description>
