      <description>I&#39;ve been working with Netty a bit recently and having built a pipeline of encoders/decoders as described in this excellent tutorial wanted to test that the encoders and decoders were working without having to send real messages around.
Luckily there is a EmbeddedChannel which makes our life very easy indeed.
Let&#39;s say we&#39;ve got a message &#39;Foo&#39; that we want to send across the wire. It only contains a single integer value so we&#39;ll just send that and reconstruct &#39;Foo&#39; on the other side.</description>
