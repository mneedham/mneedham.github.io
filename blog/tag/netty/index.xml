      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working with Netty a bit recently and having built a pipeline of encoders/decoders as described in this excellent tutorial wanted to test that the encoders and decoders were working without having to send real messages around.
 Luckily there is a EmbeddedChannel which makes our life very easy indeed.
 Let&amp;#8217;s say we&amp;#8217;ve got a message &#39;Foo&#39; that we want to send across the wire. It only contains a single integer value so we&amp;#8217;ll just send that and reconstruct &#39;Foo&#39; on the other side.</description>
