      <description>I’ve been working with Netty a bit recently and having built a pipeline of encoders/decoders as described in this excellent tutorial wanted to test that the encoders and decoders were working without having to send real messages around.
Luckily there is a EmbeddedChannel which makes our life very easy indeed.
Let’s say we’ve got a message &amp;#39;Foo&amp;#39; that we want to send across the wire. It only contains a single integer value so we’ll just send that and reconstruct &amp;#39;Foo&amp;#39; on the other side.</description>
