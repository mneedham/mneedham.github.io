      <description>I started reading Kathy Sierra’s new book &amp;#39;Badass: Making users awesome&amp;#39; a couple of weeks ago and with the gift of flights to/from Stockholm this week I’ve got through the rest of it.
I really enjoyed the book and have found myself returning to it almost every day to check up exactly what was said on a particular topic.
There were a few things that I’ve taken away and have been going on about to anyone who will listen.</description>
