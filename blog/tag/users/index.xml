      <description>I started reading Kathy Sierra&#39;s new book &#39;Badass: Making users awesome&#39; a couple of weeks ago and with the gift of flights to/from Stockholm this week I&#39;ve got through the rest of it.  I really enjoyed the book and have found myself returning to it almost every day to check up exactly what was said on a particular topic.  There were a few things that I&#39;ve taken away and have been going on about to anyone who will listen.</description>
