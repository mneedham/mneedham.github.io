      <description>I started reading Kathy Sierra&amp;#8217;s new book &#39;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra/dp/1491919019/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1426809815&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=kathy+sierra[Badass: Making users awesome]&#39; a couple of weeks ago and with the gift of flights to/from Stockholm this week I&amp;#8217;ve got through the rest of it.
 I really enjoyed the book and have found myself returning to it almost every day to check up exactly what was said on a particular topic.
 There were a few things that I&amp;#8217;ve taken away and have been going on about to anyone who will listen.</description>
