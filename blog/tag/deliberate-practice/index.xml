      <description>The Book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell
   The Review I came across this book following recommendations by Jason Yip and Steven &#39;Doc&#39; List on Twitter.
 I&amp;#8217;ve previously read The Tipping Point and Blink and I like his easy going style so it was a no brainer that I was going to read this one.
 I found that this book complimented Talent is Overrated quite nicely. Outliers covers how the story of how people became the best at what they do whereas Talent is Overrated focuses more on what you need to do if you want to become one of these people.</description>
