      <description>I&amp;#8217;d heard about The Lean Startup for a long time before I actually read it, mainly from following the &#39;http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/[Startup Lessons Learned]&#39; blog, but I didn&amp;#8217;t get the book until a colleague suggested a meetup to discuss how we might apply the ideas on our projects.
 My general learning from the book is that we need to take the idea of creating tight feedback loops, which we&amp;#8217;ve learnt in the agile/lean worlds, and apply it to product development.</description>
