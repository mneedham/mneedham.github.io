      <description>Taiichi Ohno&amp;rsquo;s Workplace Managementby Taiichi Ohno
Having completed The Toyota Way a few weeks ago I was speaking with Jasonabout what books were good to read next - he recommended this one and The Toyota Way Fieldbook.
I struggled to see a connection to software development with a lot of what I read, but there were certainly words of wisdom that we can apply to continuously improve our ability to deliver projects.</description>

      <description>The Toyota Wayby Jeffrey Liker
I was initially very skeptical about the value of lean in software development but became intrigued as to its potential value after listening to Jasonchampioning it. Since The Toyota Way is the book where many of the ideas originated from I thought it only made sense for this to be my first port of call to learn about lean.
I was worried that the book wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be that applicable to me as a software developer but I was able to see the parallels between how what we do and what is done in manufacturing have similarities.</description>
