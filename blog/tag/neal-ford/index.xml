      <description>I first came across this book when I was browsing Andy Hunt&amp;rsquo;s Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetwareon Amazon. It showed up as one of the related books.
I had expected it to be a more theoretical book than it actually is. It is full of really useful command line tips and ways to use system tools and IDEs more effectively. It only took until page 3 for me to learn something from this book - a short cut for navigating Firefox tabs which I now use all the time.</description>
