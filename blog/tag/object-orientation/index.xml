      <description>One of my favourite recent blog posts is one written by Sammy Larbi on coupling and cohesion and while discussing it with Phil he suggested that I would probably like this book and in particular the chapter on connascence which I&amp;#8217;ve previously written about.
 The Book Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Design in UML by Meilir Page-Jones
   The Review I really enjoyed reading this book and I think it&amp;#8217;s one that I could come back and read again to gain something else from in the future.</description>
