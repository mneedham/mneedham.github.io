      <description>In our latest technical book club we discussed chapter 9 - &#39;I Can&amp;#8217;t Get This Class Into A Test Harness&#39; - of Michael Feather&amp;#8217;s &#39;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131177052?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=marneesblo-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0131177052[Working Effectively With Legacy Code]&#39;.
 This chapter goes through various problems that we might have getting a class under test and then suggests different techniques to get around those problems.
 These are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the chapter:
   One approach that Feathers describes when dealing with constructors which take in a lot of values is to just pass in nulls for the parameters that we don&amp;#8217;t care about.</description>
