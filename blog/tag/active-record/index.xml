      <description>I recently learnt about quite a neat feature of Active Record called nested attributes which allows you to save attributes on associated records of a parent model.
 It&amp;#8217;s been quite useful for us as we have a few pages in our application where the user is able to update models like this.
 We would typically end up with parameters coming into the controller like this:
 class FoosController &amp;lt; ApplicationController def update # params = { :id =&amp;gt; &#34;</description>

      <description>I managed to create an interesting problem for myself while playing around with some code whereby I was ending up with validation errors appearing twice every time I called &#39;valid?&#39; on a specific model.
 I figured I was probably doing something stupid and in fact a few replies by Aaron Baldwin on a mailing list thread on &#39;rubyonrails-talk&#39; helped explain exactly what I&amp;#8217;d done:
  Are you calling require &#39;employee&#39; anywhere?</description>
