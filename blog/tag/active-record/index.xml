      <description>I recently learnt about quite a neat feature of Active Record called nested attributeswhich allows you to save attributes on associated records of a parent model.
It&amp;rsquo;s been quite useful for us as we have a few pages in our application where the user is able to update models like this.
We would typically end up with parameters coming into the controller like this:
class FoosController &amp;lt; ApplicationController def update # params = { :id =&amp;gt; &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;, :foo =&amp;gt; { :baz =&amp;gt; &amp;#34;new_baz&amp;#34;, :bar_attributes =&amp;gt; { :value =&amp;gt; &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; } } } Foo.</description>

      <description>I managed to create an interesting problem for myself while playing around with some code whereby I was ending up with validation errors appearing twice every time I called &amp;lsquo;valid?&amp;rsquo; on a specific model.
I figured I was probably doing something stupid and in fact a few replies by Aaron Baldwin on a mailing list thread on &amp;lsquo;rubyonrails-talk&#39;helped explain exactly what I&amp;rsquo;d done:
I&amp;rsquo;d put the following code into a controller elsewhere somewhat unnecessarily since it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be picking up the location of my model at the time:</description>
