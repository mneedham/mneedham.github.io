      <description>I was debugging something in the Apache Pinot code earlier this week and came across the FileSystems.getDefault().getPathMatcher, which didn’t work quite how I expected.
Figure 1. FileSystems.getDefault().getPathMatcher: IllegalArgumentException The function creates a PathMatcher that you can use to match against Paths. I was passing through a value of *.json, which was then resulting in code similar to this:
import java.nio.file.FileSystems; import java.nio.file.Path; import java.nio.file.PathMatcher; class Main { public static void main(String args[]) { PathMatcher matcher = FileSystems.</description>

      <description>After a recent IntelliJ upgrade I’ve been running into the following error when trying to attach the sources of any library being pulled in via Maven:
Unable to import maven project
It seems like this is a recent issue in the 14.x series and luckily is reasonably easy to fix by adding the following flag to the VM options passed to the Maven importer:
-Didea.maven3.use.compat.resolver And this is where you need to add it:</description>

      <description>I’ve been trying to put some tests around an Neo4j unmanaged extension I’ve been working on and ran into the following stack trace when launching the server using the Neo4j test harness:

      <description>I’ve been working with Netty a bit recently and having built a pipeline of encoders/decoders as described in this excellent tutorial wanted to test that the encoders and decoders were working without having to send real messages around.
Luckily there is a EmbeddedChannel which makes our life very easy indeed.
Let’s say we’ve got a message &amp;#39;Foo&amp;#39; that we want to send across the wire. It only contains a single integer value so we’ll just send that and reconstruct &amp;#39;Foo&amp;#39; on the other side.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I was working on the initial import of ~ 60 million bits of data into Neo4j and we kept running into a problem where the import process just seemed to freeze and nothing else was imported.
It was very difficult to tell what was happening inside the process - taking a thread dump merely informed us that it was attempting to process one line of a CSV line and was somehow unable to do so.</description>

      <description>About a year ago I wrote a blog post showing how to stream a HTTP response using Jersey/Jax RS and I recently wanted to do the same thing but this time using JSON.
A common pattern is to take our Java object and get a JSON string representation of that but that isn’t the most efficient use of memory because we now have the Java object and a string representation.</description>

      <description>If you used earlier versions of Neo4j via its Java API with Java 6 you probably have code similar to the following to ensure write operations happen within a transaction:
public class StylesOfTx { public static void main( String[] args ) throws IOException { String path = &amp;#34;/tmp/tx-style-test&amp;#34;; FileUtils.deleteRecursively(new File(path)); GraphDatabaseService db = new GraphDatabaseFactory().newEmbeddedDatabase( path ); Transaction tx = db.beginTx(); try { db.createNode(); tx.success(); } finally { tx.close(); } } } In Neo4j 2.</description>

      <description>Last week Alistair and I were working on an internal application and we needed to make a HTTPS request directly to an AWS machine using a certificate signed to a different host.
We use jersey-client so our code looked something like this:
Client client = Client.create(); client.resource(&amp;#34;https://some-aws-host.compute-1.amazonaws.com&amp;#34;).post(); // and so on When we ran this we predictably ran into trouble:
com.sun.jersey.api.client.ClientHandlerException: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: java.security.cert.CertificateException: No subject alternative DNS name matching some-aws-host.</description>

      <description>In my continued reading of Venkat Subramaniam’s &amp;#39;Functional Programming in Java&amp;#39; I’ve reached the part of the book where the http://download.java.net/jdk8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#collect-java.util.stream.Collector- function is introduced.
We want to take a collection of people, group them by age and return a map of (age -&amp;gt; people’s names) for which this comes in handy.
To refresh, this is what the Person class looks like:
static class Person { private String name; private int age; Person(String name, int age) { this.</description>

      <description>Having realised that Java 8 is due for its GA release within the next few weeks I thought it was about time I had a look at it and over the last week have been reading Venkat Subramaniam’s book.
I’m up to chapter 3 which covers sorting a collection of people. The Person class is defined roughly like so:
static class Person { private String name; private int age; Person(String name, int age) { this.</description>

      <description>At the end of last year I was playing around with running scheduled tasks to monitor a Neo4j cluster and one of the problems I ran into was that the monitoring would sometimes exit.
I eventually realised that this was because a RuntimeException was being thrown inside the Runnable method and I wasn’t handling it. The following code demonstrates the problem:
import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; import java.util.concurrent.*; public class RunnableBlog { public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException { ScheduledExecutorService executor = Executors.</description>

      <description>Earlier in the week I wanted to work out the serialVersionUID of a serializable class so that I could override its toString method without breaking everything.
I came across Frank Kim’s blog post which suggested using the serialver tool which comes with the JDK.
I created a little Maven project to test this tool out on a very simple class:
import java.io.Serializable; public class SerialiseMe implements Serializable { } If we compile that class into a JAR and then run the serialver tool we see the following output:</description>

      <description>I first came across Reactive Extensions about 4 years ago on Matthew Podwysocki’s blog but then haven’t heard much about it until I saw Matthew give a talk at Code Mesh a few weeks ago.
It seems to have grown in popularity recently and I noticed that’s there’s now a Java version called RxJava written by Netflix.
I thought I’d give it a try by changing some code I wrote while exploring cypher’s MERGE function to expose an Observable instead of Futures.</description>

      <description>Recently I’ve spent some time building a set of tests around rolling upgrades between Neo4j versions and as part of that I wanted to log the state of the cluster as the upgrade was happening.
The main thread of the test blocks waiting until the upgrade is done so I wanted to log on another thread every few seconds. Alistair pointed me at the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html which worked quite nicely.</description>

      <description>I’ve been doing some work which involves reading in CSV files, for which I’ve been using OpenCSV, and my initial approach was to read through the file line by line, parse the contents and save it into a list of maps.
This works when the contents of the file fit into memory but is problematic for larger files where I needed to stream the file and process each line individually rather than all of them after the file was loaded.</description>

      <description>Earlier in the week I wrote a blog post showing how to calculate the eigenvector centrality of an adjacency matrix using JBLAS and the next step was to work out the eigenvector centrality of a neo4j sub graph.
There were 3 steps involved in doing this:
Export the neo4j sub graph as an adjacency matrix
Run JBLAS over it to get eigenvector centrality scores for each node
Write those scores back into neo4j</description>

The first algorithm he looked at was betweenness centrality which I’ve looked at previously and is used to determine the load and importance of a node in a graph.</description>

The code looked roughly like this:
class Neo4jInstance { private Client httpClient; private URI hostname; public Neo4jInstance(Client httpClient, URI hostname) { this.httpClient = httpClient; this.hostname = hostname; } public Boolean isSlave() { String slaveURI = hostname.</description>

      <description>As long as I’ve been using a Mac I always understood that if you needed to set $JAVA_HOME for any program, it should be set to /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK.
On my machine this points to the 1.6 JDK:
$ ls -alh /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK -&amp;gt; /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents This was a bit surprising to me since I’ve actually got Java 7 installed on the machine as well so I’d assumed the symlink would have been changed:</description>

The doto macro allows us to chain method calls on an initial object and then returns the resulting object. e.g.
(doto (new java.util.HashMap) (.put &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; 1) (.put &amp;#34;b&amp;#34; 2)) -&amp;gt; {a=1, b=2} In our case this comes in quite useful in the function used to create a stadium node which initially reads like this:~ ~lisp (defn create-stadium-node [db line] (let [stadium-node (.</description>

      <description>I wrote a post about a week ago where I described how I’d added football stadiums to my football graph using neo4j spatial and after I’d done that I wanted to put it into my import script along with the rest of the data.
I thought leiningen would probably work quite well for this as you can point it at a Java class and have it be executed.
To start with I had to change the import code slightly to link stadiums to teams which have already been added to the graph:</description>

      <description>We’ve used the Jersey library on the last couple of Java based applications that I’ve worked on and one thing we’ve done on both of them is write services that communicate with each other using JSON.
On both occasions we didn’t quite setup the Jersey client correctly and ended up with an error along these lines when making a call to an end point:

      <description>On my current project we’ve spent the last day or so setting up an environment where we can deploy a couple of micro services to.
Although the machines are Windows based we’re deploying the application onto a vagrant managed VM since the production environment will be a flavour of Linux.
Initially I was getting quite confused about whether or not we were in the VM or not and ended up with this error when trying to run the compiled JAR:</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a previous post I recently moved a bunch of neo4j data loading code from Ruby to Java and as part of that process I needed to parse some CSV files.
In Ruby I was using FasterCSV which became the standard CSV library from Ruby 1.9 but it’s been a while since I had to parse CSV files in Java so I wasn’t sure which library to use.</description>

      <description>Recently we wanted to create a domain object which needed to have an external dependency in order to do a calculation and we wanted to be able to stub out that dependency in our tests.
Originally we were just new’ing up the dependency inside the domain class but that makes it impossible to control it’s value in a test.
Equally it didn’t seem like we should be passing that dependency into the constructor of the domain object since it’s not a piece of state which defines the object, just something that it uses.</description>

      <description>I’ve been playing around with the boilerpipe code base by writing some tests around it to check my understanding but ran into an interesting problem using java.util.Arrays.asList to pass a list into one of the functions.
I was testing the https://github.com/mneedham/boilerpipe/blob/master/src/main/de/l3s/boilerpipe/filters/heuristics/BlockProximityFusion.java class which is used to merge together adjacent text blocks.
I started off calling that class like this:
import static java.util.Arrays.asList; @Test public void willCallBlockProximityFustion() throws Exception { TextDocument document = new TextDocument(asList(contentBlock(&amp;#34;some words&amp;#34;), contentBlock(&amp;#34;followed by more words&amp;#34;))); BlockProximityFusion.</description>

      <description>On the system that I’m currently working on we have a data ingestion process which needs to take zip files, unzip them and then import their contents into the database.
As a result we delegate from Scala code to the system unzip command like so:
def extract { var command = &amp;#34;unzip %s -d %s&amp;#34; format(&amp;#34;/file/to/unzip.zip&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;/place/to/unzip/to&amp;#34;) var process: Process = null try { process = Runtime.getRuntime.exec(command) val exitCode = process.</description>

It’s a command line application which is called through the main method of &amp;#39;Program&amp;#39; and since there’s no dependency injection we need to be able to set System.in and System.out in order to do any testing.</description>

      <description>A function that we had to write in Java on a project that I worked on recently needed to indicate whether there was a gap in a series of data points or not.
If there were gaps at the beginning or end of the sequence then that was fine but gaps in the middle of the sequence were not.
null, 1, 2, 3 =&amp;gt; no gaps 1, 2, 3, null =&amp;gt; no gaps 1, null, 2, 3 =&amp;gt; gaps The Java version looked a bit like this:</description>

Map Map evaluates a high order function on all the elements in a collection and then returns a new collection containing the results of the function evaluation.</description>

      <description>We have been making good use of Hamcrest matchers on my current project for making assertions, and have moved almost entirely away from the more traditional JUnit assertEquals approach.
There are several reasons why I find the Hamcrest matcher approach to be more productive - it’s more flexible, more expressive and when an assertion fails we have a much better idea about why it has failed than if we use a JUnit assertion for example.</description>

      <description>One of the features that I dislike in Java compared to C# is checked exceptions.
For me an exception is about a situation which is exceptional, and if we know that there is a possibility of it happening and even have that possibility defined in our code then it doesn’t seem all that exceptional to me.
Having said that they do at least provide information which you can’t help but notice about what can go wrong when you make a call to a particular method.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago my colleague Mark Thomas posted about working on a C# project after 10 years working in Java, and being someone who has worked on projects in both languages fairly consistently (3 Java projects, 2 .NET projects) over the last two years I thought it would be interesting to do a comparison between the two.
The standard ThoughtWorks joke is that you just need to remember to capitalise the first letter of method names in C# and then you’re good to go but I think there’s more to it than that.</description>

      <description>A colleague and I have spent the past couple of days spiking solutions for connecting to LDAP servers from Ruby.
We decided that the easiest way to do this is by using OpenDS, an open source directory service based on LDAP.
One option we came up with for doing this was to make use of the Java libraries for connecting to the LDAP server and then calling through to these from our Ruby code using the Ruby Java Bridge.</description>

      <description>While playing around with JBehave I was reminded of my dislike of the import static feature which was introduced in Java 1.5.
Using import static allows us to access static members defined in another class without referencing the class name. For example suppose we want to use the following method in our code:
Math.max(1,2); Normally we would need to include the class name (Math) that the static function (max) belongs to.</description>

      <description>The alternative to dealing with java.util.Date which I wrote about in a previous post is to make use of the Joda Time library. I’m led to believe that a lot of the ideas from Joda Time will in fact be in Java 7.
Nevertheless when testing with Joda Time there are times when it would be useful for us to have control over the time our code is using.</description>

      <description>Assuming that you are unable to use Joda Time on your project, there are some simple ways that I have come across that allow you to not suffer at the hands of java.util.Date.
What’s wrong with java.util.date in the first place? First of all java.util.date is mutable. This means that if you create a java.util.date object its state can be modified after creation.
This means that you can do an operation like the following, for example:</description>
