      <description>One of the changes that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed in my coding now compared to around 7 or 8 months ago is that whenever there&amp;rsquo;s some operations to be performed on a collection I am far more inclined to think of how to do those operations using a functional approach.
I&amp;rsquo;ve written previously about the ways I&amp;rsquo;ve been making useoffunctionalcollectionparameters in my code but what I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really considered was that the way of thinking about the problem we want to solve is slightly different.</description>

      <description>One of the interesting cases where I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed we tend to avoid functionalcollection parametersin our code base is when there&amp;rsquo;s the possibility of the collection being null.
The code is on the boundary of our application&amp;rsquo;s interaction with another service so it is actually a valid scenario that we could receive a null collection.
When using extension methods, although we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get a null pointer exception by calling one on a null collection, we would get a &amp;lsquo;source is null&amp;rsquo; exception when the expression is evaluated so we need to protect ourself against this.</description>
