      <description>One of the things that we want to do reasonably frequently is set an attribute (most often a class) on a HTML element depending on the value of a variable.
 I always forget how to do this in Haml so I thought I better write it down so I&amp;#8217;ll remember next time!
 Let&amp;#8217;s say we want to add a success class to a paragraph if the variable correct is true and not have any value if it&amp;#8217;s false.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been writing a little web app in which I wanted to display cypher queries inside a
  tag which was then prettified using SyntaxHighlighter but I was having problems with how code on new lines was being displayed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; I had the following Haml code to display a query looking up Gareth Bale in a graph: ~~~haml %pre{ :class =&amp;gt; &#34;brush: cypher; gutter: false; toolbar: false;&#34;} START player = node:players(&#39;name:&#34;</description>
