      <description>The Book Lean Software Development by Mary and Tom Poppendieck
The Review I&amp;rsquo;m keen to learn how the ideas from The Toyota Way can be applied to software development and as far as I know this is the first book which addressed this, hence the reason for me reading it.
What did I learn?  I found the idea of financial based decisions particularly interesting - I&#39;ve often had situations when developing software where there are trade offs to make and it would have been much easier to make them if we had a dollar value associated with each potential solution.</description>
