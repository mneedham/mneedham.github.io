      <description>Despite the fact that I’ve been working full time in software for almost 8 years now every now and then I still need a reminder of how useful reading logs can be in helping solve problems.

The first was a couple of weeks ago when Tim and I were pairing on moving some applications from Passenger to Unicorn and were testing whether or not we’d done so successfully.</description>
