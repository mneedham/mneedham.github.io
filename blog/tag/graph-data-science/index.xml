      <description>The Neo4j Graph Data Science Library provides efficiently implemented, parallel versions of common graph algorithms for Neo4j, exposed as Cypher procedures. It recently published version 1.5, which introduces some fun new algorithms.
   In this blog post, we&amp;#8217;re going to explore the newly added Speaker-Listener Label Propagation algorithm with the help of a twitter dataset.
 Launching Neo4j We&amp;#8217;re going to run Neo4j with the Graph Data Science Library using the following Docker Compose configuration:</description>
