      <description>One of the most interesting things I have discovered since starting at ThoughtWorks earlier this month is the emphasis that is placed on giving feedback.
 The first lesson we were taught about giving feedback was that it could be one of two types. Either it should Strengthen Confidence or Increase Effectiveness.
 In Layman&amp;#8217;s term that means that if you want to make a positive comment about somebody&amp;#8217;s contribution then you should make reference to something specific that you believe they have done well so that they can continue doing it.</description>
