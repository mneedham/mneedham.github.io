      <description>I picked up Daniel Kahneman&#39;s &#39;Thinking Fast and Slow&#39; after a recommendation by Mike Jones in early 2013 - it&#39;s taken me quite a while to get through it.
The book starts by describing our two styles of thinking...
 System 1 – operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.  System 2 – allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations.</description>
