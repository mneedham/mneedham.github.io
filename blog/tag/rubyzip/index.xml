      <description>In the world of Ruby I’ve been working on a script which needs to unzip a file and then run an installer which is only available after unpacking it.
We’ve been using the rubyzip gem to do so but so far it hasn’t felt intuitive to me coming from the Java/C# world.
ZipFile is the class we need to use and at first glance I had thought that it would be possible to just pass the zip file name to the &amp;#39;extract&amp;#39; method and have it do all the work for me!</description>
