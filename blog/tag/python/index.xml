      <description>I’ve been playing around with ChromaDB and I wanted to programatically get a list of the embedding functions, which was a little trickier thna I expected. In this blog post, we’ll explore how I failed and then succeeded at this task.
But first, let’s install ChromaDB:
pip install chromadb The embedding functions live in the chromadb.utils.embedding_functions module. So my first thought was that I could list all the things defined in that module and then check which ones were a sub class of EmbeddingFunction:</description>

      <description>My colleagues Sandeep Dabade and Kulbir Nijjer recently wrote a three part blog post series about the StarTree index, an Apache Pinot indexing technique that dynamically builds a tree structure to maintain aggregates across a group of dimensions. I’ve not used this index before and wanted to give it a try and in this blog post, I’ll share what I learned.
I’ve put all the code in the startreedata/pinot-recipes GitHub repository in case you want to try it out yourself.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a previous blog post, I’ve been using Python’s Poetry library, but today it stopped working! In this blog post, I’ll explain what happened and how I got it working again.
It started off innocent enough, with me trying to create a new project:
poetry init But instead of seeing the usual interactive wizard, I got the following error:
Output dyld[20269]: Library not loaded: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.11/3.11.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/Python Referenced from: &amp;lt;1B2377F9-2187-39A9-AA98-20E438024DE2&amp;gt; /Users/markhneedham/Library/Application Support/pypoetry/venv/bin/python Reason: tried: &amp;#39;/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.</description>

      <description>I’ve been creating a demo showing how to ingest Avro-encoded data from Apache Kafka into Apache Pinot and ran into a deprecation warning. In this blog post, I’ll show how to update code using the Confluent Kafka Python client to get rid of that warning.
I started by installing the following libraries:
pip install confluent-kafka avro urllib3 requests And then my code to publish an Avro encoded event to Kafka looked like this:</description>

      <description>I’ve been trying out Python’s Poetry dependency management tool recently and I really like it, but couldn’t figure out how to get it setup as VSCode’s Python interpreter. In this blog post, we’ll learn how to do that.
One way to add the Python interpreter in VSCode is to press Cmd+Shift+p and then type Python Interpreter. If you select the first result, you’ll see something like the following:

      <description>I’ve been meaning to take Quix Streams for a spin for a while and got the chance while building a recent demo. Quix Streams is a library for building streaming applications on time-series data, but I wanted to use it to do some basic consuming and producing of JSON messages. That’s what we’re going to do in this blog post.
We’re going to use Redpanda to store our messages. We’ll launch a Redpanda instance using the following Docker Compose file:</description>

      <description>I often write little Python scripts that import code from other local modules and a common problem I have when using the Python REPL is that I update the code in the other modules and then can’t use the new functionality without restarting the REPL and re-importing everything. At least so I thought! It turns out there is a way to refresh those modules and that’s what we’ll be exploring in this blog post.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I wrote a blog post about some different ways to take the first element from a Python list. Afterward I was chatting to my new rubber duck, ChatGPT, which suggested the next function on an iterator as an alternative approach. And so that’s what we’re going to explore in this blog post.
The next function gets the first value from an iterator and optionally returns a provided default value if the iterator is empty.</description>

      <description>When writing Python scripts, I often find myself wanting to take the first item from a collection and ignore the rest of the values. I usually use something like values[0] to take the first value from the list, but I was curious whether I could do better by using destructuring. That’s what we’re going to explore in this blog post.
We’ll start with a list that contains some names:</description>

      <description>I’m still playing around with data returned by Apache Pinot’s HTTP API and I wanted to sort a dictionary of segment names by partition id and index. In this blog post we’re going to look into how to do that.
We’ll start with the following dictionary:
segments = { &amp;#34;events3__4__1__20230605T1335Z&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;CONSUMED&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;events3__4__13__20230605T1335Z&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;CONSUMED&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;events3__4__20__20230605T1335Z&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;CONSUMING&amp;#34; } As I mentioned above, I want to sort the dictionary’s items by partition id and index, which are embedded inside the key name.</description>

I started with a map that looked a bit like this:
segments = { &amp;#34;events3__4__1__20230605T1335Z&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;CONSUMED&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;events3__4__20__20230605T1335Z&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;CONSUMING&amp;#34; } And then I iterated over and printed each item like this:</description>

      <description>Another gem from Fluent Python is that you can name slices. How did I not know that?!
Let’s have a look how it works using an example of a Vehicle Identification Number, which has 17 characters that act as a unique identifier for a vehicle. Different parts of that string mean different things.
So given the following VIN:
vin = &amp;#34;2B3HD46R02H210893&amp;#34; We can extract components like this:
print(f&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; World manufacturer identifier: {vin[0:3]} Vehicle Descriptor: {vin[3:9]} Vehicle Identifier: {vin[9:17]} &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;.</description>

      <description>I’ve been reading Fluent Python and learnt about pattern matching with the match/case statement, introduced in Python 3.10. You can use it instead of places where you’d otherwise use if, elif, else statements.
I created a small example to understand how it works. The following function takes in a list where the first argument should be foo, followed by a variable number of arguments, which we print to the console:</description>

      <description>I was recently trying to convert a CSV file to Parquet format and came across a StackOverflow post that described a collection of different options. My CSV file was bigger than the amount of memory I had available, which ruled out some of the methods. In this blog post we’re going to walk through some options for exporting big CSV files to Parquet format.

First, let’s install Pandas, numpy, and altair:
pip install pandas altair numpy And now we’ll import those modules into a Python script or Jupyter notebook:
import pandas as pd import altair as alt import numpy as np Next, we’ll create a DataFrame containing the vaccinations rates of a couple of regions:</description>

The UK government host a dashboard at coronavirus.data.gov.uk, which contains charts and tables showing all of the above.
One thing I haven’t been able to find, however, is a drill down of vaccinations by local area and age group. So I’m going to try to build my own!</description>

Pre requisites Let’s start by installing the following libraries:
pip install pandas altair altair_viewer Next let’s import them, as shown below:
import pandas as pd import altair as alt Visualising % of first doses Now we’re going to create a DataFrame that contains two columns - one contains the year and week number, the other the percentage of 1st doses administered.</description>

      <description>The UK government publishes Coronavirus vaccinations data on coronavirus.data.gov.uk, but I wanted to create some different visualisations so I downloaded the data and have been playing with it in the mneedham/covid-vaccines GitHub repository.
I massaged the data so that I have rows in a Pandas DataFrame representing the numbers of first doses, second doses, and total doses done each day. I then wanted to filter this DataFrame based on the type of dose, but initially got a bit stuck.</description>

      <description>In my continued playing around with the Strava API, I wanted to write a script to download all of my Strava activities to a JSON file.
As I mentioned in a previous blog post, the approach to authenticating requests has changed in the last two years, so we first need to generate an access token via the OAuth endpoint. Luckily Odd Eirik Igland shared a script showing how to solve most of the problem, and I’ve adapted it to do what I want.</description>

We’ll start with the following map:
x = {&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;: 1, &amp;#34;b&amp;#34;: 2, &amp;#34;c&amp;#34;: 3, &amp;#34;d&amp;#34;: 4} {&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;: 1, &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;: 2, &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;: 3, &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;: 4} We want to filter this map so that we only have the keys a and c.</description>

from datetime import date import click Now we’ll create a sub command that takes two parameters: date-start and date-end. These parameters have the type DateTime, and we can pass a string in the format yyyy-mm-dd from the command line:</description>

I thought I might be able to get a dump of all the libraries and their dependencies, but while searching I came across this article which does a good job of explaining why that’s not possible.
Finding Python Dependencies The best we can do is generate a dependency graph of our locally installed packages using the excellent pipdeptree tool.</description>

      <description>I often find myself downloading web pages with Python’s requests library to do some local scrapping when building datasets but I’ve never come up with a good way for downloading those pages in parallel.
Below is the code that I use. First we’ll import the required libraries:
import os import requests from time import time as timer And now a function that streams a response into a local file:</description>

      <description>Last week Nigel released v4 of Py2neo and given I was just getting ready to write some queries against my Strava activity graph I thought I’d give it a try.
If you want to learn how to create your own Strava graph you should read my previous post, but just to recap, this is the graph model that we created:
Let’s get to it!
tl;dr the code in this post is available as a Jupyter notebook so if you want the code and nothing but the code head over there!</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks I came across a paper titled Parameter Free Hierarchical Graph-Based Clustering for Analyzing Continuous Word Embeddings via Abigail See&amp;#39;s blog post about ACL 2017.
The paper explains an algorithm that helps to make sense of word embeddings generated by algorithms such as Word2vec and GloVe.
I’m fascinated by how graphs can be used to interpret seemingly black box data, so I was immediately intrigued and wanted to try and reproduce their findings using Neo4j.</description>

      <description>In my previous post we looked at how to get up and running with the node2Vec algorithm, and in this post we’ll learn how we can feed graph embeddings into a simple Tensorflow model.
Recall that node2Vec takes in a list of edges (or relationships) and gives us back an embedding (array of numbers) for each node.
This time we’re going to run the algorithm over a movies recommendation dataset from the Neo4j Sandbox.</description>

      <description>In my explorations of graph based machine learning, one algorithm I came across is called node2Vec. The paper describes it as &amp;#34;an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks&amp;#34;.
So what does the algorithm do? From the website:
The node2vec framework learns low-dimensional representations for nodes in a graph by optimizing a neighborhood preserving objective. The objective is flexible, and the algorithm accommodates for various definitions of network neighborhoods by simulating biased random walks.</description>

I’ll use the same data as Sidath, so if you want to follow along you’ll need to download these files:

      <description>I’ve been playing around with saving and loading scikit-learn models and needed to serialize and deserialize Numpy arrays as part of the process.
I could use pickle but that seems a bit overkill so I decided instead to save the byte representation of the array. We can get that representation by calling the tobytes method on a Numpy array:
import numpy as np &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; np.array([ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ]) array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; np.</description>

      <description>When coding in Python I often find myself with lists containing key/value pairs that I want to convert to a dictionary.
In a recent example I had the following code:
values = [{&amp;#39;key&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;name&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;value&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Mark&amp;#39;}, {&amp;#39;key&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;age&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;value&amp;#39;: 34}] And I wanted to create a dictionary that had the keys name and age and their respective values. The easiest way to convert this list to a dictionary is to iterate over the list and construct the dictionary key by key:</description>

I record my runs with the Strava app and it has an API that returns lat/long coordinates for each run in the Google encoded polyline algorithm format.
We can use the polyline library to decode these values into a list of lat/long tuples. For example:

We need to get a better score with each of the classifiers in the ensemble otherwise they can be excluded.
We have a TF/IDF based classifier as well as well as the classifiers I wrote about in the last post.</description>

This is the code snippet that intrigued me:
vocabulary = defaultdict() vocabulary.default_factory = vocabulary.__len__ Let’s quickly see how it works by adapting an example from scikit-learn:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from collections import defaultdict &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vocabulary = defaultdict() &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vocabulary.default_factory = vocabulary.__len__ &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vocabulary[&amp;#34;foo&amp;#34;] 0 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vocabulary.items() dict_items([(&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;, 0)]) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vocabulary[&amp;#34;bar&amp;#34;] 1 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vocabulary.</description>

If we want to get a count of the number of null fields by column we can use the following code, adapted from Poonam Ligade’s kernel:

      <description>As I mentioned in a blog post a couple of weeks ago, I’ve been playing around with the Kaggle House Prices competition and the most recent thing I tried was training a random forest regressor.
Unfortunately, although it gave me better results locally it got a worse score on the unseen data, which I figured meant I’d overfitted the model.
I wasn’t really sure how to work out if that theory was true or not, but by chance I was reading Chris Albon’s blog and found a post where he explains how to inspect the importance of every feature in a random forest.</description>

      <description>I’ve been playing around with the data in Kaggle’s House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques and while replicating Poonam Ligade’s exploratory analysis I wanted to see if I could create a model to fill in some of the missing values.
Poonam wrote the following code to identify which columns in the dataset had the most missing values:
import pandas as pd train = pd.read_csv(&amp;#39;train.csv&amp;#39;) null_columns=train.columns[train.isnull().any()] &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(train[null_columns].isnull().sum()) LotFrontage 259 Alley 1369 MasVnrType 8 MasVnrArea 8 BsmtQual 37 BsmtCond 37 BsmtExposure 38 BsmtFinType1 37 BsmtFinType2 38 Electrical 1 FireplaceQu 690 GarageType 81 GarageYrBlt 81 GarageFinish 81 GarageQual 81 GarageCond 81 PoolQC 1453 Fence 1179 MiscFeature 1406 dtype: int64 The one that I’m most interested in is LotFrontage, which describes &amp;#39;Linear feet of street connected to property&amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>In my last post I showed how to map Strava runs using data that I’d extracted from their https://strava.github.io/api/v3/activities/ API, but the API returns a lot of other data that I discarded because I wasn’t sure what I should keep.
The API returns a nested JSON structure so the easiest solution would be to save each run as an individual file but I’ve always wanted to try out PostgreSQL’s JSON data type and this seemed like a good opportunity.</description>

      <description>I’m a big Strava user and spent a bit of time last weekend playing around with their API to work out how to map all my runs.
Strava API and polylines This is a two step process:
Call the /athlete/activities/ endpoint to get a list of all my activities
For each of those activities call /activities/ endpoint to get more detailed information for each activity&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;
That second API returns a &amp;#39;polyline&amp;#39; property which the documentation describes as follows:</description>

      <description>In my last blog post I showed how to convert a JSON document containing meetup groups into a CSV file using Luigi, the Python library for building data pipelines. As well as creating that CSV file I wanted to go back to the meetup.com API and download all the members of those groups.
This was a rough flow of what i wanted to do:

      <description>I’ve been playing around with the Python library Luigi which is used to build pipelines of batch jobs and I struggled to find an example of an ExternalProgramTask so this is my attempt at filling that void.
I’m building a little data pipeline to get data from the meetup.com API and put it into CSV files that can be loaded into Neo4j using the LOAD CSV command.
The first task I created calls the /groups endpoint and saves the result into a JSON file:</description>

      <description>In my last post I attempted to cluster Game of Thrones episodes based on character appearances without much success. After I wrote that post I was flicking through the scikit-learn clustering documentation and noticed the following section which describes some of the weaknesses of the K-means clustering algorithm:
Inertia is not a normalized metric: we just know that lower values are better and zero is optimal. But in very high-dimensional spaces, Euclidean distances tend to become inflated (this is an instance of the so-called “curse of dimensionality”).</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago Praveena and I created a Game of Thrones dataset to use in a workshop and I thought it’d be fun to run it through some machine learning algorithms and hopefully find some interesting insights.
The dataset is available as CSV files but for this analysis I’m assuming that it’s already been imported into neo4j. If you want to import the data you can run the tutorial by typing the following into the query bar of the neo4j browser:</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago I downloaded the meta data for a few thousand computer science papers so that I could try and write a mini recommendation engine to tell me what paper I should read next.
Since I don’t have any data on which people read each paper a collaborative filtering approach is ruled out, so instead I thought I could try content based filtering instead.
Let’s quickly check the Wikipedia definition of content based filtering:</description>

      <description>Last week we hosted a Game of Thrones based intro to Cypher at the Women Who Code London meetup and in preparation had to scrape the wiki to build a dataset.
I’ve built lots of datasets this way and it’s a painless experience as long as the pages make liberal use of CSS classes and/or IDs.
Unfortunately the Game of Thrones wiki doesn’t really do that so I had to find another way to extract the data I wanted - extracting elements based on their position to more prominent elements on the page.</description>

I use Python for most of my hacking these days and if HTTP requests are required the requests library is my first port of call.
I started out with the following script

I thought there’d be an obvious way of doing this but if there is it’s evaded me so far and I ended up calculating the different between two datetime objects which gave me the following timedelta object: ~python &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import datetime &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; start = datetime.</description>

I found a couple of WordPress CSV plugins but unfortunately I couldn’t get any of them to work and ended up working with the raw XML data that WordPress produces when you &amp;#39;export&amp;#39; a blog.
I had the problem of the export being incomplete which I &amp;#39;solved&amp;#39; by importing the posts in two parts of a few years each.</description>

      <description>As part of the BBC live text scraping code I’ve been working on I needed to take an iterator of raw events created by a generator and transform this into an iterator of cards shown in a match.
The structure of the raw events I’m interested in is as follows:
Line 1: Player booked
Line 2: Player fouled
Line 3: Information about the foul
e.g.
events = [ {&amp;#39;event&amp;#39;: u&amp;#39;Booking Pedro (Barcelona) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.</description>

      <description>In my previous blog post I described how I’d refactored some scraping code I’ve been working on to use iterators and ended up with a function which returned a generator containing all the events for one BBC live text match:

      <description>Over the last week I’ve been building a set of scripts to scrape the events from the Bayern Munich/Barcelona game and I’ve ended up with a few hundred lines of nested for statements, if statements and mutated lists. I thought it was about time I did a bit of refactoring.
The following is a function which takes in a match file and spits out a collection of maps containing times &amp;amp; events.</description>

      <description>I’ve been trying to write some Python code to extract the players and the team they represented in the Bayern Munich/Barcelona match into a CSV file and had much more difficulty than I expected.
I have some scraping code (which is beyond the scope of this article) which gives me a list of (player, team) pairs that I want to write to disk. The contents of the list is as follows:</description>

      <description>I’m planning to write a variant of the TF/IDF algorithm over the HIMYM corpus which weights in favour of term that appear in a medium number of documents and as a prerequisite needed a function that when given a number of documents would return a weighting.
It should return a higher value when a term appears in a medium number of documents i.e. if I pass in 10 I should get back a higher value than 200 as a term that appears in 10 episodes is likely to be more interesting than one which appears in almost every episode.</description>

      <description>I found myself wanting to flatten an array of arrays while writing some Python code earlier this afternoon and being lazy my first attempt involved building the flattened array manually:
episodes = [ {&amp;#34;id&amp;#34;: 1, &amp;#34;topics&amp;#34;: [1,2,3]}, {&amp;#34;id&amp;#34;: 2, &amp;#34;topics&amp;#34;: [4,5,6]} ] flattened_episodes = [] for episode in episodes: for topic in episode[&amp;#34;topics&amp;#34;]: flattened_episodes.append({&amp;#34;id&amp;#34;: episode[&amp;#34;id&amp;#34;], &amp;#34;topic&amp;#34;: topic}) for episode in flattened_episodes: print episode If we run that we’ll see this output:</description>

      <description>I’ve been playing around with topics models again and recently read a paper by David Mimno which suggested the following heuristic for working out which words should go onto the stop list:
A good heuristic for identifying such words is to remove those that occur in more than 5-10% of documents (most common) and those that occur fewer than 5-10 times in the entire corpus (least common).
I decided to try this out on the HIMYM dataset that I’ve been working on over the last couple of months.</description>

      <description>I’ve been playing around with importing Twitter data into Neo4j and since Neo4j can’t store dates natively just yet I needed to convert a date string to timestamp.
I started with the following which unfortunately throws an exception:

Here’s an example of the text file I was parsing:

My technique for finding some of those people was to pick a person from the Neo4j kernel team who’s very good at systems programming and uses twitter which led me to Mr Chris Vest.</description>

      <description>Following on from Rik van Bruggen’s blog post on a QCon graph he’s created ahead of this week’s conference, I was curious whether we could extract any interesting relationships between talks based on their abstracts.
Talks are already grouped by their hosting track but there’s likely to be some overlap in topics even for talks on different tracks. I therefore wanted to extract topics and connect each talk to the topic that describes it best.</description>

      <description>Following on from my previous posts on training a classifier to pick out the speaker in sentences of HIMYM transcripts the next thing to do was train a random forest of decision trees to see how that fared.
I’ve used scikit-learn for this before so I decided to use that. However, before building a random forest I wanted to check that I could build an equivalent decision tree.
I initially thought that scikit-learn’s DecisionTree classifier would take in data in the same format as nltk’s so I started out with the following code:</description>

      <description>Over the last couple of weeks I’ve been experimenting with different classifiers to detect speakers in HIMYM transcripts and in all my attempts so far the only features I’ve used have been words.
This led to classifiers that were overfitted to the training data so I wanted to generalise them by introducing parts of speech of the words in sentences which are more generic.
First I changed the function which generates the features for each word to also contain the parts of speech of the previous and next words as well as the word itself:</description>

      <description>Last week I wrote a blog post describing a decision tree I’d trained to detect the speakers in a How I met your mother transcript and after writing the post I wondered whether a simple classifier would do the job.
The simple classifier will work on the assumption that any word followed by a &amp;#34;:&amp;#34; is a speaker and anything else isn’t. Here’s the definition of a NaiveClassifier:
import nltk from nltk import ClassifierI class NaiveClassifier(ClassifierI): def classify(self, featureset): if featureset[&amp;#39;next-word&amp;#39;] == &amp;#34;:&amp;#34;: return True else: return False As you can see it only implements the classify method and executes a static check.</description>

This initially seemed like a really simple problem as most of the initial sentences I looked at weere structured like this:
&amp;lt;speaker&amp;gt;: &amp;lt;sentence&amp;gt; If there were all in that format then we could write a simple regular expression and then move on but unfortunately they aren’t.</description>

      <description>I’ve previously written about extracting TF/IDF scores for phrases in documents using scikit-learn and the final step in that post involved writing the words into a CSV file for analysis later on.
I wasn’t sure what the most appropriate tool of choice for that analysis was so I decided to explore the data using Python’s pandas library and load it into Neo4j and write some Cypher queries.
To do anything with Neo4j we need to first load the CSV file into the database.</description>

A subset of one of the CSV files I’ve been working with looks like this:

After a bit of searching around it seems that matplotlib is the go to library for this job and I thought an interesting thing to plot would be how often each of the main characters appear in each episode across the show.</description>

      <description>In my continued playing around with a How I met your mother data set I needed to find out the last episode that happened in a season so that I could use it in a chart I wanted to plot.
I had this CSV file containing each of the episodes:
$ head -n 10 data/import/episodes.csv NumberOverall,NumberInSeason,Episode,Season,DateAired,Timestamp 1,1,/wiki/Pilot,1,&amp;#34;September 19, 2005&amp;#34;,1127084400 2,2,/wiki/Purple_Giraffe,1,&amp;#34;September 26, 2005&amp;#34;,1127689200 3,3,/wiki/Sweet_Taste_of_Liberty,1,&amp;#34;October 3, 2005&amp;#34;,1128294000 4,4,/wiki/Return_of_the_Shirt,1,&amp;#34;October 10, 2005&amp;#34;,1128898800 5,5,/wiki/Okay_Awesome,1,&amp;#34;October 17, 2005&amp;#34;,1129503600 6,6,/wiki/Slutty_Pumpkin,1,&amp;#34;October 24, 2005&amp;#34;,1130108400 7,7,/wiki/Matchmaker,1,&amp;#34;November 7, 2005&amp;#34;,1131321600 8,8,/wiki/The_Duel,1,&amp;#34;November 14, 2005&amp;#34;,1131926400 9,9,/wiki/Belly_Full_of_Turkey,1,&amp;#34;November 21, 2005&amp;#34;,1132531200 I started out by parsing the CSV file into a dictionary of (seasons -&amp;gt; episode ids):</description>

      <description>Last week the FIFA Ballon d’Or 2014 was announced and along with the announcement of the winner the individual votes were also made available.
Unfortunately they weren’t made open in a way that Ben Wellington (of IQuantNY fame) would approve of - the choice of format for the data is a PDF file!
I wanted to extract this data to play around with it but I wanted to automate the extraction as I’d done when working with Google Trends data.</description>

      <description>Following on from last week’s blog post where I found the most popular words in How I met your mother transcripts, in this post we’ll have a look at how we can pull out sentences and then phrases from our corpus.
The first thing I did was tweak the scraping script to pull out the sentences spoken by characters in the transcripts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
Each dialogue is separated by two line breaks so we use that as our separator.</description>

      <description>I recently came across Python’s Counter tool which makes it really easy to count the number of occurrences of items in a list.
In my case I was trying to work out how many times words occurred in a corpus so I had something like the following:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from collections import Counter &amp;gt;&amp;gt; counter = Counter([&amp;#34;word1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;word2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;word3&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;word1&amp;#34;]) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; print counter Counter({&amp;#39;word1&amp;#39;: 2, &amp;#39;word3&amp;#39;: 1, &amp;#39;word2&amp;#39;: 1}) I wanted to write a for loop to iterate over the counter and print the (key, value) pairs and started with the following:</description>

      <description>After reading Emil’s blog post about dark data a few weeks ago I became intrigued about trying to find some structure in free text data and I thought How I met your mother’s transcripts would be a good place to start.
I found a website which has the transcripts for all the episodes and then having manually downloaded the two pages which listed all the episodes, wrote a script to grab each of the transcripts so I could use them on my machine.</description>

I started with a date in this format:
date_text = &amp;#34;13SEP2014&amp;#34; So the first step is to translate that into a Python date - the strftime section of the documentation is useful for figuring out which format code is needed:</description>

      <description>Nathan and I have been playing around with different scikit-learn machine learning classifiers and we wanted to run different combinations of features through each one and work out which gave the best result.
We started with a list of features:
all_columns = [&amp;#34;Fare&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Sex&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Pclass&amp;#34;, &amp;#39;Embarked&amp;#39;] itertools#combinations allows us to create combinations with a length of our choice:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import itertools as it &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list(it.combinations(all_columns, 3)) [(&amp;#39;Fare&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Sex&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Pclass&amp;#39;), (&amp;#39;Fare&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Sex&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Embarked&amp;#39;), (&amp;#39;Fare&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Pclass&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Embarked&amp;#39;), (&amp;#39;Sex&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Pclass&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Embarked&amp;#39;)] We wanted to create combinations of arbitrary length so we wanted to combine a few invocations of that functions like this:</description>

      <description>I’ve been working through Coursera’s Linear Algebra course and since all of the exercises are in Python I’ve been playing around with it again.
One interesting thing I learnt is that you can construct dictionaries using a list comprehension type syntax.
For example, if we start with the following dictionaries:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = { &amp;#34;a&amp;#34;: 1, &amp;#34;b&amp;#34;:2 } &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; y = {1: &amp;#34;mark&amp;#34;, 2: &amp;#34;will&amp;#34;} &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x {&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;: 1, &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;: 2} &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; y {1: &amp;#39;mark&amp;#39;, 2: &amp;#39;will&amp;#39;} We might want to create a new dictionary which links from the keys in x to the values in y.</description>

      <description>As part of some code I’ve been playing around I wanted to remove an item from a tuple which wasn’t particularly easy because Python’s tuple data structure is immutable.
I therefore needed to create a new tuple excluding the value which I wanted to remove.
I ended up writing the following function to do this but I imagine there might be an easier way because it’s quite verbose:
def tuple_without(original_tuple, element_to_remove): new_tuple = [] for s in list(original_tuple): if not s == element_to_remove: new_tuple.</description>

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = arange(20).reshape(4,5) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x array([[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14], [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]]) I wanted to get the values for the 2nd column of each row which would return an array containing 1, 6, 11 and 16.</description>

      <description>We wanted to tail one of the log files simultaneously on 12 servers this afternoon to try and see if a particular event was being logged and rather than opening 12 SSH sessions decided to get Fabric to help us out.
My initial attempt to do this was the following:
fab -H host1,host2,host3 -- tail -f /var/www/awesome/current/log/production.log It works but the problem is that by default Fabric runs the specified command one machine after the other so we’ve actually managed to block Fabric with the tail command on &amp;#39;host1&amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>The latest algorithm that we had to code in Algorithms 2 was the Knapsack problem which is as follows:
The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.</description>
