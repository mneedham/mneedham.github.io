      <description>My colleague Dermot Kilroyattended the DDD 2010 Excangein London last week and one of the ideas that he&amp;rsquo;s been sharing with us from that is that of thinking how the user would solve a given problem without a technological solution i.e. how was something done before computers existed.
This encourages us to take a bigger picture view and can actually lead to a much simpler solution than we&amp;rsquo;d otherwise come up with.</description>
