      <description>My colleague Dermot Kilroy attended the DDD 2010 Exchange in London last week and one of the ideas that he&amp;#8217;s been sharing with us from that is that of thinking how the user would solve a given problem without a technological solution i.e. how was something done before computers existed.
 This encourages us to take a bigger picture view and can actually lead to a much simpler solution than we&amp;#8217;d otherwise come up with.</description>
