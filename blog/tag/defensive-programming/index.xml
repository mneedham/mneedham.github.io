      <description>A few weeks ago I was looking at quite an interesting bug in our system which initially didn&amp;rsquo;t seem possible.
On one of our screens we have some questions that the user fills in which read a bit like this:
i.e. you would only see the 2nd and 3rd questions on the screen if you answered yes to the first question.
However, if you went to the next page on the form having answered &amp;lsquo;Yes&amp;rsquo; to the first question and then came back to this page and changed your answer to the first question to &amp;lsquo;No&amp;rsquo; then when the data got submitted to the server the answers to the other two questions would still be posted.</description>
