      <description>I spent a bit of time this afternoon marveling at the non intuitiveness of working out how to ignore files in Svn.
Normally I&amp;rsquo;d just use Tortoise SVNas it makes it so easy for you but I really wanted to know how to do it from the shell!
After a bit of Googling and conversation with a colleagueI think I have it figured out to some extent.
If you only have one pattern or file that you want to ignore then the following command should do the trick.</description>
