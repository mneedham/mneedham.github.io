      <description>I spent a bit of time this afternoon marveling at the non intuitiveness of working out how to ignore files in Svn.
Normally I’d just use Tortoise SVN as it makes it so easy for you but I really wanted to know how to do it from the shell!
After a bit of Googling and conversation with a colleague I think I have it figured out to some extent.</description>
