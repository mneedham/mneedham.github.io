      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been in India for around 4 months and in that time I think I&amp;rsquo;ve probably interviewed more people than I have in the last 4 years.
Over this time I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realise that the two main things I&amp;rsquo;m looking for in candidates are passion and ability to communicate effectively.
It&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to pick up on whether someone is passionate about what they do in a conversation or while pairing with them but I find the communication aspect a bit more tricky.</description>
