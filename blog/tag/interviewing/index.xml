      <description>I’ve been in India for around 4 months and in that time I think I’ve probably interviewed more people than I have in the last 4 years.
Over this time I’ve come to realise that the two main things I’m looking for in candidates are passion and ability to communicate effectively.
It’s relatively easy to pick up on whether someone is passionate about what they do in a conversation or while pairing with them but I find the communication aspect a bit more tricky.</description>
