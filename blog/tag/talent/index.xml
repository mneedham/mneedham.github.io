      <description>Talent is Overratedby Geoff Colvin
I came across this book on Jason Yip&amp;rsquo;s Twitter feedwhile the idea of 10,000 hours to become an expert at any given skill was being discussed. I&amp;rsquo;m reading Outliersas well and the two books seem to complement each other quite well.
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in how we can apply deliberate practice in software development, perhaps using the medium of coding dojos, to become better developers in a more effective manner than just normal practice.</description>
