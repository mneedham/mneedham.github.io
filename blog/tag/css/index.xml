      <description>I’ve spent the last few days working with CSS, and in particular trying to make a layout which works perfectly fine in Firefox work properly in Internet Explorer 6.
I’m far from an expert when it comes to this but I’ve picked up a few lessons from our attempts to get identical layouts in both browsers.
Internet Explorer seems to do some crazy stuff when it comes to padding and margins - we were often ending up with huge margins where we hadn’t even specified any.</description>
