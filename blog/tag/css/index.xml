      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last few days working with CSS, and in particular trying to make a layout which works perfectly fine in Firefox work properly in Internet Explorer 6.
I&amp;rsquo;m far from an expert when it comes to this but I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up a few lessons from our attempts to get identical layouts in both browsers.
  Internet Explorer seems to do some crazy stuff when it comes to padding and margins - we were often ending up with huge margins where we hadn&#39;t even specified any.</description>
