      <description>One problem that we&amp;#8217;ve been trying to solve today is how to make a RESTlet resource non cacheable.
 The reason for this is that when a user logs out of the system and then hits the back button they shouldn&amp;#8217;t be able to see that page, but instead should see the login form.
 After several hours of trawling Google and trying out various different suggestions we came across the idea of setting &#39;cache-control&#39; with the value &#39;no-store&#39; in the response headers.</description>
