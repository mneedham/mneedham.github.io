      <description>I often need to minimise the schema and table config files that you use to configure Apache Pinot so that they donâ€™t take up so much space. After doing this manually for ages, I came across the json-stringify-pretty-compact library, which speeds up the process.
We can install it like this:
npm install json-stringify-pretty-compact And then I have the following script:
minify.mjs import pretty from &amp;#39;json-stringify-pretty-compact&amp;#39;; let inputData = &amp;#39;&amp;#39;; process.</description>

      <description>Another presentation that I gave at XP Day was one covering some visualisations Liz, Uday and I have created from various data we have about our project, gathered from Git, Go and Mingle.
Visualisations
These were some of the things that I learned from doing the presentation:
The various graphs I presented in the talk have a resolution of 1680 x 1050 which is a much higher resolution than what was available on the projector.</description>
