      <description>Another presentation that I gave at XP Day was one covering some visualisations Liz, Udayand I have created from various data we have about our project, gathered from Git, Go and Mingle.
These were some of the things that I learned from doing the presentation:
As a result it was necessary to scroll up and down/side to side when demonstrating each visualisationso that people could actually see them.
Either I need to work out how to get the resolution of the projector higher or be able to shrink the images to the right size so they&amp;rsquo;d fit more naturally.</description>
