      <description>I read Dan Pink&amp;rsquo;s A Whole New Mindearlier in the year but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard of The Adventures of Johnny Bunkountil my colleague Sumeet Moghementioned it in a conversation during ThoughtWorks India&amp;rsquo;s XConf, an internal conference run here.
The book is written in the Mangaformat so it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly quick to read and it gives 6 ideas around building a career.
I&amp;rsquo;m generally not a fan of the idea of &amp;lsquo;building a career&amp;rsquo; - generally when I hear that phrase it involves having a &amp;lsquo;five year&amp;rsquo; plan and other such concepts which I consider to be pointless.</description>
