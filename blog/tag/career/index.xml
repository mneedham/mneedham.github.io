      <description>I read Dan Pink&amp;#8217;s A Whole New Mind earlier in the year but I hadn&amp;#8217;t heard of The Adventures of Johnny Bunko until my colleague Sumeet Moghe mentioned it in a conversation during ThoughtWorks India&amp;#8217;s XConf, an internal conference run here.
 The book is written in the Manga format so it&amp;#8217;s incredibly quick to read and it gives 6 ideas around building a career.
 I&amp;#8217;m generally not a fan of the idea of &#39;building a career&#39; - generally when I hear that phrase it involves having a &#39;five year&#39; plan and other such concepts which I consider to be pointless.</description>
