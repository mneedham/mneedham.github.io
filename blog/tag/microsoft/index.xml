      <description>The recently released Oxite code base has taken a bit of a hammering in the blogosphere for a variety of reasons - the general feeling being that it doesn’t really serve as a particularly good example of an ASP.NET MVC application.
I was intrigued to read the code though - you can always learn something by doing so and reading code is one of the ares that I want to improve in.</description>

      <description>I went to see Object Mentor’s Dave Thomas give a talk about cloud computing on Tuesday evening in a combined meeting of the Sydney Alt.NET user group and several others.
I’d not seen him speak before but several colleagues had seen him at JAOO earlier this year so he came highly recommended.
We started off with a plug for the JAOO Australia 2009 conference which will again be in Brisbane and Sydney at the beginning of May.</description>

      <description>I’ve been having trouble trying to work out how to build our projects in msbuild in release mode without creating the customary pdb files that seem to be created by default.
I tried calling msbuild.exe with the &amp;#39;Release&amp;#39; configuration:
&amp;#39;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\MSBuild.Exe ( Proj.csproj /p:OutputPath=\output\path\ /p:Configuration=Release)&amp;#39; To no avail. It still created the pdb file. Next I tried setting the &amp;#39;DebugSymbols&amp;#39; property to false:
&amp;#39;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\MSBuild.Exe ( Proj.csproj /p:OutputPath=\output\path\ /p:Configuration=Release /p:DebugSymbols=false)&amp;#39; Still it created the file.</description>
