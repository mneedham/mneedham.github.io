      <description>The recently released Oxite code base has taken a bit of a hammering in the blogosphere for a variety of reasons - the general feeling being that it doesn&amp;#8217;t really serve as a particularly good example of an ASP.NET MVC application.
 I was intrigued to read the code though - you can always learn something by doing so and reading code is one of the ares that I want to improve in.</description>

      <description>I went to see Object Mentor&amp;#8217;s Dave Thomas give a talk about cloud computing on Tuesday evening in a combined meeting of the Sydney Alt.NET user group and several others.
 I&amp;#8217;d not seen him speak before but several colleagues had seen him at JAOO earlier this year so he came highly recommended.
 We started off with a plug for the JAOO Australia 2009 conference which will again be in Brisbane and Sydney at the beginning of May.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been having trouble trying to work out how to build our projects in msbuild in release mode without creating the customary pdb files that seem to be created by default.
 I tried calling msbuild.exe with the &#39;Release&#39; configuration:
 &#39;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\MSBuild.Exe ( Proj.csproj /p:OutputPath=\output\path\ /p:Configuration=Release)&#39;   To no avail. It still created the pdb file. Next I tried setting the &#39;DebugSymbols&#39; property to false:
 &#39;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\MSBuild.Exe ( Proj.csproj /p:OutputPath=\output\path\ /p:Configuration=Release /p:DebugSymbols=false)&#39;   Still it created the file.</description>
