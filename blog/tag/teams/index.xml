      <description>On the majority of the teams that I&amp;#8217;ve worked on there&amp;#8217;s been a time where everyone seems to be disagreeing with each other about almost everything and the whole situation becomes pretty tense for all involved.
 The first time I came across this it seemed quite dysfunctional but I was introduced to Bruce Tuckman&amp;#8217;s model of group development which helps to explain what&amp;#8217;s going on.

      <description>The Book The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni
   The Review I heard about this book a while ago but I was intrigued to actually get a copy by Darren Cotterill, the Iteration Manager on the project I&amp;#8217;m working on at the moment.
 I was particularly interested in learning whether the ideas of agile and/or lean help to solve any of these dysfunctions.
   What did I learn?</description>
