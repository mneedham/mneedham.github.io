      <description>As I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned in a couple of previous posts I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with creating a Vagrant VM that I can use for my neo4j hacking which has involved a lot of messing around with installing apt packages.
 There are loads of different ways of working out what&amp;#8217;s going on when packages aren&amp;#8217;t installing as you&amp;#8217;d expect so I thought it&amp;#8217;d be good to document the ones I&amp;#8217;ve been using so I can find them more easily next time.</description>
