      <description>As I&#39;ve mentioned in a couple of previous posts I&#39;ve been playing around with creating a Vagrant VM that I can use for my neo4j hacking which has involved a lot of messing around with installing apt packages.
There are loads of different ways of working out what&#39;s going on when packages aren&#39;t installing as you&#39;d expect so I thought it&#39;d be good to document the ones I&#39;ve been using so I can find them more easily next time.</description>
