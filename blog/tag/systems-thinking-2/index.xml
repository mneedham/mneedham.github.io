      <description>Earlier this year Liz Keoghgave a talk at QCon London titled &amp;lsquo;Learning and Perverse Incentives: The Evil Hat&amp;rsquo; where she eventually encouraged people to try and game the systems that they take part in.
Over the last month or so we&amp;rsquo;ve had two different metrics visibly on show and are therefore prime targets for being gamed.
The first metric is one we included on our build radiator which shows how many commits to the git repository each person has for that day.</description>

      <description>In &amp;lsquo;Thinking In Systems: A Primer&amp;rsquo; one of the most interesting ideas that Donella Meadows describes is what Herbert Simon coined &amp;lsquo;bounded rationality&amp;rsquo;:
Later on in the chapter the following idea is suggested:
This helps explains something that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed happen quite frequently.
Someone who was previously non management gets pulled into a management position and &amp;lsquo;mysteriously&amp;rsquo; starts acting exactly like all the others in that type of role rather than having a holistic view.</description>

      <description>In her keynote at XP 2011Esther Derbyencouraged us to ask the question &amp;ldquo;in what world does that make sense?&amp;rdquo; whenever we encounter something which we consider to be stupid or ridiculous.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of it at the time but my colleague Pat Kuahas been asking me the question whenever I&amp;rsquo;ve been describing something that I find confusing to him.
After about the third time I noticed that its quite a nice tool for getting us to reflect on the systems and feedback loops that may be encouraging the behaviour witnessed.</description>

      <title>System Traps: Rule Beating</title>
      <link>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2011/05/14/system-traps-rule-beating/</link>

      <description>In &amp;lsquo;Thinking In Systems&amp;rsquo; section five focuses on systems which produce &amp;ldquo;truly problematic behaviour&amp;rdquo; and one of these so called system traps is known as &amp;lsquo;rule beating&amp;rsquo;.
Rule beating occurs when the agents in a system take evasive action to get around the intent of rules in a system:
A common system where we see this in organisations is around training budgets.
Each individual will be given a certain amount of money to spend each year and if they don&amp;rsquo;t spend it then they lose it.</description>

      <title>Feedback Loops: Human Decisions</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Donella Meadows&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Thinking In Systems: A Primer&amp;rsquo;, an introductory text on systems thinking, and after 30 pages or so the author poses the following challenge:
Meadows has quite a nice way of guiding us to thinking about systems by referring to &amp;lsquo;stocks&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;flows&amp;rsquo;.
For example the following diagram represents the flows into and out from a water reservoir:
The &amp;lsquo;water in reservoir&amp;rsquo; is the stock in this system while rain/river inflow act as the in flows and evaporation/discharge are the out flows.</description>

      <title>Chris Argyris: Espoused Theory vs Theory in Action</title>

      <description>Via some combination of Christian Blunden, Pat Kua, David Joyceand Benjamin MitchellI&amp;rsquo;ve been spending some time lately reading about the work of Chris Argyris.
I&amp;rsquo;ve previously come across his name while reading The Fifth Disciplinebut I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise how interesting his work actually is.
One of the interesting concepts I&amp;rsquo;ve come across so far is the difference between espoused theory and theory in use:
Espoused theory
Theory-in-use
There are two areas that really stood out for me when I read these definitions.</description>
