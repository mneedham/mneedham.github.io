      <description>In my continued playing with the Materialize SQL streaming database, I wanted to analyse a JSON file of tweets that contain arrays of hashtags. It took me a while to figure out to do this and in this blog post I&amp;#8217;ll take you through the steps I tried.
   The JSON file that we&amp;#8217;re going to analyse looks like this and we&amp;#8217;ll save that file in a data directory locally.</description>

      <description>I recently learnt about Materialize, a SQL streaming database, via their Series B fundraising announcement, and thought I&amp;#8217;d take it for a spin.
 My go-to dataset for new databases is Strava, an app that I use to record my runs. It has an API that returns a JSON representation of each run, containing information like the distance covered, elapsed time, heart rate metrics, and more.
 I&amp;#8217;ve extracted my latest 30 activities to a file in the JSON lines format and in this post we&amp;#8217;re going to analyse that data using Materialize.</description>
