      <description>Phil Haack wrote a post a few weeks ago about the law of demeter and how it&amp;rsquo;s not just about reducing the number of dots that appear on one line.
This is a nice side effect of following the law of demeter but I often feel that the main benefit we get from following it is that code becomes easier to change since we haven&amp;rsquo;t exposed the state of an object all over the place.</description>
