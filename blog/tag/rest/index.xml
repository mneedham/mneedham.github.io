      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been using Ruby/Rails on my current project to create a RESTful web service. One of the problems we wanted to solve was making the data queried by this web service configurable from our build.
We started off with the following bit of code (which makes use of the recently added ActiveResource class):   1 2 3 ~~~  class MyClass &amp;lt; ActiveResource::Base  self.site = &amp;ldquo;http://localhost:3000/&amp;ldquo; end~~~    And then called this class as follows:   1 ~~~  MyClass.</description>
