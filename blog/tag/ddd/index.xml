      <description>One of my favourite parts of the Domain Driven Designbook is where Eric Evans talks about making implicit concepts in our domain model explicit.
The book describes this process like so:
Lu and I were working on a small application to parse the WCF message log file on our project into more readable chunks whereby each request in the file would be outputted into another file so that it would be possible to read them individually.</description>

      <title>DDD: Only for complex projects?</title>

      <description>One of the things I find a bit confusing when it comes to Domain Driven Design is that some of the higher profile speakers/user group contributors on the subject have expressed the opinion that DDD is more suitablewhen we are dealing with complex projects.
I think this means complex in terms of the domain but I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly worked on some projects where we&amp;rsquo;ve been following certainly some of the ideas of DDD and have got some value out of doing so in domains which I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say were particularly complex.</description>

      <title>DDD: Recognising relationships between bounded contexts</title>

      <description>One of the big takeaways for mefrom the Domain Driven Design trackat the recent QCon Londonconference was that the organisational patterns in the second half of the book are probably more important than the actual patterns themselves.
There are various patterns used to describe the relationships between different bounded contexts:
I think it&amp;rsquo;s useful for us to know which situation we are in because then we can make decisions on what we want to do while being aware of the various trade offs we will need to make.</description>

      <title>How does the user language fit in with the ubiquitous language?</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some work this week around trying to ensure that we have a ubiquitous languageto describe aspects of the domain across the various different systems on my project.
It&amp;rsquo;s not easy as there are several different teams involved but one thing we realised while working on the language is that the language of the business is not the same as the language of the user.
Although this is the first time that I recall working on a project where the language of the user is different to the language of the domain I&amp;rsquo;m sure there must be other domains where this is the case as well.</description>

      <title>Internal/External Domain Models</title>

      <description>One of the underlying characteristic of most of the projects I have worked on is that we have defined our own domain model.
On my current project due to the fact that most of the logic in the system is being handled through other services we decided to use WCFmessages as the domain model, meaning that our domain model is being defined externally by the team defining the message contracts.</description>

      <title>Similarities between Domain Driven Design &amp; Object Oriented Programming</title>

      <description>At the Alt.NET UK Conferencewhich I attendedover the weekend it occurred to me while listening to some of the discussions on Domain Driven Designthat a lot of the ideas in DDD are actually very similar to those being practiced in Object Oriented Programmingand related best practices.
There was quite a bit of discussion in the session about anaemic domain models.
An anaemic domain model is one where a lot of the objects are merely data holders and do not actually have any behaviour inside them.</description>

      <title>Should we always use Domain Model?</title>

      <description>During the discussionabout Domain Driven Design at the Alt.NETconference I felt like the idea of the Rich Domain Model was being represented as the only way to design software but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel that this is the case.
As always in software we never have a silver bulletand there are times when Domain Model is not necessarily the best choice, just as there are times when OOP is not necessarily the best choice.</description>
