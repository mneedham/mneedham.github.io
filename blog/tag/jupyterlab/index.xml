      <description>In the latest version of Jupyter Notebook/Lab (at least), the output of each cell is shown in full, regardless of how long it is. I wanted to limit the height of the output and then scroll through it within that inner window, ideally by triggering a keyboard shortcut.
I learnt how to do this with the help of Stack Overflow. First, you need to open the settings editor by typing Cmd + , on a Mac or by clicking on that screen from the top menu:</description>

      <description>I’ve been using Jupyter Lab notebooks in some of my recent videos on Learn Data with Mark and I wanted to show cell execution timings so that viewers would have an idea of how long things were taking. I thought I’d need to use a custom timer, but it turns out there’s quite a nice plug-in, which we’ll learn about in this blog post.
The plug-in is called jupyterlab-execute-time and it shows a live view of the time that a cell takes to execute, as well as showing the execution time afterward.</description>
