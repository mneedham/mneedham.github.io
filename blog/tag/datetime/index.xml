      <title>Neo4j 3.4: Syntax Error - Text cannot be parsed to a Duration (aka dealing with empty durations)</title>

      <description>As I continued with my travels with Neo4j 3.4&amp;#8217;s temporal data type I came across some fun edge cases when dealing with empty durations while importing data.
 Imagine we&amp;#8217;re trying to create 3 nodes from the following array of input data. Two of the rows have invalid durations!
 UNWIND [ {id: 12345, duration: &#34;PT2M20S&#34;}, {id: 12346, duration: &#34;&#34;}, {id: 12347, duration: null} ] AS row MERGE (run:Run {id: row.</description>

      <description>Continuing with my explorations of Strava data in Neo4j I wanted to share some things I learnt while trying to work out my pace for certain distances.
 Before we get into the pace calculations let&amp;#8217;s first understand how the duration function works. If we run the following query we might expect to get back the same value that we put in&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203;
 RETURN duration({seconds: 413.77}).seconds AS seconds   ╒═════════╕ │&#34;</description>

      <description>In my last blog post I showed how to compare instances of Neo4j&amp;#8217;s Duration data type, and in the middle of the post I realised that I needed to use the APOC library to return the value in the format I wanted. This was the solution I ended up with:
 WITH duration({seconds: 100}) AS duration RETURN apoc.text.lpad(toString(duration.minutes), 2, &#34;0&#34;) + &#34;:&#34; + apoc.text.lpad(toString(duration.secondsOfMinute), 2, &#34;0&#34;)   If we run that query this is the output:</description>

      <description>Neo4j 3.4 saw the introduction of the temporal date type, which my colleague Adam Cowley covered in his excellent blog post, and in this post I want to share my experience using durations from my Strava runs.
 I&amp;#8217;ll show how to load the whole Strava dataset in another blog post but for now we&amp;#8217;ll just manually create some durations based on the elapsed time in seconds that Strava provides. We can run the following query to convert duration in seconds into the duration type:</description>
