      <description>At a university, students who have questions about the lecture content or coursework can visit the professor and have a one-on-one conversation.
&amp;hellip;
At the beginning of every meetup, we give everyone a name tag, and provide a whiteboard with two columns, “teachers” and “students”.
Attendees are encouraged to put their name and interests in both columns. From there, everyone can [&amp;hellip;] go in search of someone from the opposite column who shares their interests.</description>
