      <description>In my last blog post I showed how to convert a JSON document containing meetup groups into a CSV file using Luigi, the Python library for building data pipelines. As well as creating that CSV file I wanted to go back to the meetup.com API and download all the members of those groups.
This was a rough flow of what i wanted to do:
  Take JSON document containing all groups   Parse that document and for each group:    Call the /members endpoint   Save each one of those files as a JSON file    Iterate over all those JSON files and create a members CSV file   In the previous post we created the GroupsToJSON task which calls the /groups endpoint on the meetup API and creates the file /tmp/groups.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with the Python library Luigi which is used to build pipelines of batch jobs and I struggled to find an example of an ExternalProgramTask so this is my attempt at filling that void.   I&#39;m building a little data pipeline to get data from the meetup.com API and put it into CSV files that can be loaded into Neo4j using the LOAD CSV command.  The first task I created calls the /groups endpoint and saves the result into a JSON file: import luigi import requests import json from collections import Counter class GroupsToJSON(luigi.</description>
