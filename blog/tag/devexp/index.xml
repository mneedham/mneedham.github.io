      <description>My former colleague Ade Oshineye recently linked me to a post he&amp;rsquo;s written about Developer Experience (#devexp)which is described as:
I think it&amp;rsquo;s quite an interesting idea and I particularly like two of the ideas suggested:
The idea here is that if you provide a library, developers should be able to go from downloading to &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; in 5 minutes.
For instance if your users struggle with getting OAuth working then create abstractions that handle it for them rather than documenting the 6 most common problems or writing up the &amp;lsquo;simple 12 step process&amp;rsquo; for getting it working.</description>
