      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing with the Leaflet.js library over the Christmas holidays to visualise running routes drawn onto the map using a Polyline and I wanted to zoom the map the right amount to see all the points.
 Pre requisites We have the following HTML to define the div that will contain the map.
 &amp;lt;div id=&#34;container&#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div id=&#34;map&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; height: 100%&#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;   We also need to import the following Javascript and CSS files:</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m a big Strava user and spent a bit of time last weekend playing around with their API to work out how to map all my runs.
   Strava API and polylines This is a two step process:
  Call the /athlete/activities/ endpoint to get a list of all my activities
  For each of those activities call /activities/ endpoint to get more detailed information for each activity&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working on creating a UI to make searching for the football stadiums that I wrote about last week a bit easier and I thought I&amp;#8217;d give Leaflet JS a try.
 Leaflet is a Javascript library which was recommended to me by Jason Neylon) and can be used as a wrapper around Open Street Map.
 I started by creating a simple form where you could fill in a lat/long and distance and it would centre the map on that lat/long and show you a list of the stadiums within that diameter next to the map.</description>
