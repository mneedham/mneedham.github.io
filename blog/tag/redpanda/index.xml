      <description>A few years ago I wrote a blog post showing how to delete a Kafka topic when running on Docker and while that approach still works, I think I’ve now got a better way. And that’s what we’re going to learn about in this blog post.
Spin up Kafka Cluster We’re going to spin up Kafka using the following Docker Compose file:
docker-compose.yml version: &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; services: zookeeper: image: zookeeper:3.8.0 hostname: zookeeper container_name: zookeeper-delete ports: - &amp;#34;2181:2181&amp;#34; environment: ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181 ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000 kafka: image: wurstmeister/kafka:latest restart: unless-stopped container_name: &amp;#34;kafka-delete&amp;#34; ports: - &amp;#34;9092:9092&amp;#34; expose: - &amp;#34;9093&amp;#34; depends_on: - zookeeper environment: KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper-delete:2181/kafka KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 0 KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: kafka-delete KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka-delete:9093,OUTSIDE://localhost:9092 KAFKA_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://0.</description>

      <title>Redpanda: Configure pruning/retention of data</title>

      <description>I wanted to test how Apache Pinot deals with data being truncated from the underlying stream from which it’s consuming, so I’ve been trying to work out how to prune data in Redpanda. In this blog post, I’ll share what I’ve learnt so far.
We’re going to spin up a Redpanda cluster using the following Docker Compose file:
docker-compose.yml version: &amp;#39;3.7&amp;#39; services: redpanda: container_name: &amp;#34;redpanda-pruning&amp;#34; image: docker.redpanda.com/vectorized/redpanda:v22.2.2 command: - redpanda start - --smp 1 - --overprovisioned - --node-id 0 - --kafka-addr PLAINTEXT://0.</description>

      <title>Redpanda: Viewing consumer group offsets from __consumer_offsets</title>

      <description>Redpanda supports consumer groups, which are sets of consumers that cooperate to consume data from topics. The consumers in a group are assigned a partition and they keep track of the last consumed offset in the __consumer_offsets topic. I wanted to see how many messages had been consumed by a consumer group and that’s what we’ll explore in this post.
My first thought was to query the __consumer_offsets topic using rpk topic consume.</description>
