      <description>My colleague Dan Northpresented a version of a talk he first did at QCon Londontitled &amp;lsquo;Pimp my architecture&amp;rsquo; at the ThoughtWorks Sydney community college on Wednesday night. He&amp;rsquo;ll also be presenting it at JAOOin Sydneyand Brisbanein a couple of weeks time.
The slides for the talk are hereand it&amp;rsquo;s also available on InfoQ.
To begin with it was a case of SOA gone bad with clients heavily coupled to services via WSDL definitions, a lot of code duplication, a complex/flaky architecture featuring a non standard JBoss and a team where the developers worked in silos.</description>
