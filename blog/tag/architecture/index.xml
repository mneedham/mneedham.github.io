      <description>My colleague Dan North presented a version of a talk he first did at QCon London titled &amp;#39;Pimp my architecture&amp;#39; at the ThoughtWorks Sydney community college on Wednesday night. He’ll also be presenting it at JAOO in Sydney and Brisbane in a couple of weeks time.
The slides for the talk are here and it’s also available on InfoQ.
What did I learn? I quite liked the way the talk was laid out - Dan laid out a series of problems that he’s seen on some projects he’s worked on and then showed on the next slide where he planned to take the architecture.</description>
