      <description>I wrote previously about the idea of tackling the risky tasks in a project early on - an idea that I learnt about when reading Alistair Cockburn&amp;#8217;s Crystal Clear.
 Towards the end of the post I wondered whether we could apply this idea at a story level whereby we would identify the potentially risky parts of a story and make sure that we addressed those risks before they became problematic to us.</description>
