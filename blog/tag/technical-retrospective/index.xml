      <description>We decided to run a technical retrospective on our code base yesterday afternoon but apart from one blog post on the subject and a brief mention on Pat Kua’s blog I couldn’t find much information with regards to how to run one.
We therefore decided to take a fairly similar approach to our weekly retrospectives in terms of having one column for &amp;#39;Like&amp;#39; and one for &amp;#39;Dislike&amp;#39;. In addition we had columns for &amp;#39;Want To Know More About&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Patterns&amp;#39;.</description>
