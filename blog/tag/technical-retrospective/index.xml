      <description>We decided to run a technical retrospective on our code base yesterday afternoon but apart from one blog post on the subject and a brief mention on Pat Kua&amp;#8217;s blog I couldn&amp;#8217;t find much information with regards to how to run one.
 We therefore decided to take a fairly similar approach to our weekly retrospectives in terms of having one column for &#39;Like&#39; and one for &#39;Dislike&#39;. In addition we had columns for &#39;Want To Know More About&#39; and &#39;Patterns&#39;.</description>
