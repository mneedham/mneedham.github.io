      <description>In Discussing the UndiscussableWilliam Noonan describes the ladder of inference, a tool which can be used to help us achieve double loop learning with respect to our interactions with other people.
It also helps people understand how they interpret that information and how they apply their interpretation to the issue or problem at hand.
