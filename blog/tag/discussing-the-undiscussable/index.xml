      <description>In Discussing the Undiscussable William Noonan describes the ladder of inference, a tool which can be used to help us achieve double loop learning with respect to our interactions with other people.
 Ladder of Inference helps people identify what information or facts are used as the basis for their reasoning process. It also helps people understand how they interpret that information and how they apply their interpretation to the issue or problem at hand.</description>
