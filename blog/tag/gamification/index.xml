      <description>On the recommendation of J.B. Rainsberger I&#39;ve been reading &#39;Reality is Broken&#39; - a book which talks about how we can apply some of the things games designers have learned about getting people engaged to real life.
The author, Jane McGonigal, also has a TED talk on the topic which will help you get a flavour for the topic.
I was particularly interested in trying to see how her ideas could be applied in a software context and indeed how they are already being applied.</description>
