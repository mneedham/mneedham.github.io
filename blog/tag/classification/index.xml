      <description>For the Kaggle Spooky Author Identification I wanted to combine multiple classifiers together into an ensemble and found the VotingClassifier that does exactly that.  We need to predict the probability that a sentence is written by one of three authors so the VotingClassifier needs to make a &#39;soft&#39; prediction. If we only needed to know the most likely author we could have it make a &#39;hard&#39; prediction instead.  We start with three classifiers which generate different n-gram based features.</description>
