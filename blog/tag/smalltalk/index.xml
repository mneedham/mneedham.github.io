      <description>Continuing on from last week’s look at Smalltalk, in our latest coding dojo we spent some time investigating the SUnit testing framework, how we would use it to write some tests and looking at how it actually works.
The Format We had 3 people for the dojo this week and the majority was spent looking at the code on a big screen and trying to understand between us what was going on.</description>

      <description>We decided to play around with Smalltalk a bit in our latest coding dojo.
A lot of the ideas that I value the most in terms of writing software effectively seem to have originally come from the Smalltalk community and a colleague of mine has been reading Kent Beck’s TDD by Example book and was really keen to try out the language to see where Kent’s original ideas came from.</description>
