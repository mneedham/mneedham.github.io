      <description>We&amp;#8217;re deploying the StarTree developer site, dev.startree.ai, to Vercel, and recently needed to do some redirects of a few pages. I initially added individual redirects for each page, but there were eventually too many pages and I wanted to automate it. In this post we&amp;#8217;ll learn how to do that.
  Figure 1. Vercel: Redirect wildcard (nested) paths  We wanted to redirect everything under https://dev.startree.ai/docs/thirdeye to https://dev.startree.ai/docs/startree-enterprise-edition/startree-thirdeye/ and started off by using wild card path matching, as seen in the vercel.</description>
