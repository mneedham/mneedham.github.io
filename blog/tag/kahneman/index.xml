      <description>Kahneman points out that we only remember the intuitions which turned out to be true, noone talks about those intuitions which turned out to be false. He also cautions us to consider the role that luck plays in any success.In the world of software this reliance on intuition is often used when interviewing people for jobs and choosing who to hire based on an intuitive judgement. Kahneman suggests making a list of about 6 traits that are pre-requisites for the position and then ranking each candidate against those.</description>
