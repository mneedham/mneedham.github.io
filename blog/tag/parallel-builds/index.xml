      <description>One of the things that we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on lately to improve the overall time that our full build takes to run is to split the acceptance tests into several small groups of tests so that we can run them in parallel.
We are using Cruise as our build server so the ability to have multiple agents running against different parts of the build at the same time comes built it.</description>
