      <description>The Book Fearless Change by Mary Lyan Manns and Linda Rising
The Review I came across this book while watching an interview with Linda Rising on InfoQ. She mentioned some ideas from Malcolm Gladwell’s The Tipping Point which intrigued me and a strong recommendation from a colleague ensured this book made it onto my reading list.
I am not currently working on a project where I need to instigate a lot of change so I was going slightly against my own principle of only reading books when I need to, but I recalled several times previously when I have tried to introduce what I thought were good ideas and didn’t really get anywhere.</description>
