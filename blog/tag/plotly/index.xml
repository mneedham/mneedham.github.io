      <description>I’ve been playing around with Microsoft’s TrueSkill algorithm, which attempts to quantify the skill of a player using the Bayesian inference algorithm. A rating in this system is a Gaussian distribution that starts with an average of 25 and a confidence of 8.333. I wanted to visualise various ratings using Plotly and that’s what we’ll be doing in this blog post.
To save you from having to install TrueSkill, we’re going to create a named tuple to simulate a TrueSkill Rating object:</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my blog post about building a Real-Time Crypto Dashboard, I’ve recently been working with the Dash low-code framework for building interactive data apps.
I was using the dcc.Interval component to automatically refresh components on the page and wanted to make the refresh interval configurable. In this blog post we’ll learn how to do that.
