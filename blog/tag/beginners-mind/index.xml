      <description>Zen Mind, Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Mindby Shunryu Suzuki
I first came across the actual term beginner&amp;rsquo;s mindwhen reading through the &amp;lsquo;Wear The White Belt&amp;rsquo; chapter of Apprenticeship Patternsalthough it was often mentioned to me on one of the first projects I did at ThoughtWorks a couple of years ago that people liked teaching me things because I just took the information in pretty much without questioning.
I find nowadays that I analyse what people tell me way a lot more and then compare it against what I already know to see if it adds to my understanding.</description>
