      <description>A couple of weeks I came across a paper titled Parameter Free Hierarchical Graph-Based Clustering for Analyzing Continuous Word Embeddings via Abigail See&#39;s blog post about ACL 2017.
  The paper explains an algorithm that helps to make sense of word embeddings generated by algorithms such as Word2vec and GloVe.
 I&amp;#8217;m fascinated by how graphs can be used to interpret seemingly black box data, so I was immediately intrigued and wanted to try and reproduce their findings using Neo4j.</description>

      <description>In my last blog post I showed how to create a multi class classification ensemble using scikit-learn&amp;#8217;s http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#voting-classifier and finished mentioning that I didn&amp;#8217;t know which classifiers should be part of the ensemble.
 We need to get a better score with each of the classifiers in the ensemble otherwise they can be excluded.
 We have a TF/IDF based classifier as well as well as the classifiers I wrote about in the last post.</description>
