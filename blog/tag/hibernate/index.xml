      <description>Continuing with my mini Hibernate mappings series, this post talks about the different ways of setting up the test data for our Hibernate tests.
  Where to test the mappings from?
  How to test for equality?
  How to setup the test data?
   There are a couple of ways that we can setup data for Hibernate tests.
 Insert Hibernate Object This approach involves creating a new object and saving it to the database using the save method on the Hibernate session.</description>

      <description>I started a mini Hibernate series with my last post where I spoke of there being three main areas to think about when it comes to testing:
  Where to test the mappings from?
  How to test for equality?
  How to setup the test data?
   Once we have worked out where to test the mappings from, if we have decided to test them through either our repository tests or directly from the Hibernate session then we have some choices to make around how to test for equality.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve had the opportunity to work with Hibernate and it&amp;#8217;s .NET twin NHibernate on several of my projects and one of the more interesting decisions around its use is working out the best way to test the hibernate mappings that hook together our domain model and the database.
 There are three decisions to make around how best to do this:
  Where to test the mappings from?
  How to test for equality?</description>
