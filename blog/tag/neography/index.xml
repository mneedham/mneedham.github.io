      <description>I’ve been playing around with neo4j using the neography gem to create a graph of all the people in ThoughtWorks and the connections between them based on working with each other.
I created a UI where you could type in the names of two people and see when they’ve worked together or the path between the shortest path between them if they haven’t.
I thought it would be cool to have auto complete functionality when typing in a name but I couldn’t figure out how to partially query the index of people’s names that I’d created.</description>
