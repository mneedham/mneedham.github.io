      <description>At ThoughtWorks we don&amp;rsquo;t have line managers but people can choose to have a sponsor - typically someone who has worked in the company for longer/has more experience in the industry than them - who can help them navigate the organisation better.
From hearing people talk about sponsors over the last 6 years it seemed like quite a few people sponsored the majority and there were probably a few people who didn&amp;rsquo;t have a sponsor.</description>

      <description>I spent some time recently playing around with gephi - an open source platform for creating visualisations of graphs - to get a bit more insight into the ThoughtWorks graph which I&amp;rsquo;ve created in neo4j.
I followed Max De Marxi&amp;rsquo;s blog post to create a GEFX (Graph Exchange XML Format) file to use in gephi although I later learned that you can import directly from neo4j into gephi which I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried yet.</description>
