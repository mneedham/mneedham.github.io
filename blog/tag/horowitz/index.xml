      <description>Horowitz suggests that he used to be too positive and would shield bad news from his employees as he thought he&amp;rsquo;d make the problem worse by transferring the burden onto them.
He came to the realisation that this was counter productive since he often wasn&amp;rsquo;t the best placed person to fix a problem e.g. if it was a problem with the product then the engineering team needed to know so they could write the code to fix it.</description>
