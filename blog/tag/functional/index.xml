      <description>While talking through my understanding of the Select method which can be applied to collections in C# with a colleague, it became clear that C# doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to use the same names for these type of operations as are used in the world of functional programming.
Coincidentally on the same day I came across Bill Six&amp;rsquo;s post about using functional collection parameters in Ruby, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d see what the equivalent operations are in C#.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite things introduced into C# recently is the new ForEach method which can be applied to (apparently only!) lists.
Last week we had a situation where we wanted to make use of the ForEach method on an IDictionary which we were using to store a collection of Selenium clients.
IDictionary&amp;lt;string, ISelenium&amp;gt; seleniumClients = new Dictionary&amp;lt;string, ISelenium&amp;gt;();  We wanted to write a piece of code to exit all of the clients when our tests had completed.</description>
