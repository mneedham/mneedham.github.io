      <description>I recently came across Pavel Brodzinski&amp;rsquo;s blogand while browsing through some of his most recent posts I came across one discussing when unit testing doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.
The majority of what Pavel says I&amp;rsquo;ve seen happen before on projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on but I disagree with his suggestion that writing unit tests is boring:
I think it depends on the way that the unit tests are being written.
When I first started working at ThoughtWorks I used to think that writing tests was boring and that it was much more fun writing production code.</description>

      <description>Following on from my post around the definition of a unit test, a recent discussion on the Test Driven Development mailing listled me to question what my own approach is for writing unit tests.
To self quote from my previous post:
Quite simple in theory but as I have learnt (and am still learning) the hard way, much harder to do in practice. Breaking that down further what does it actually mean?</description>

      <description>One of the questions which came up during the Sydney Alt.NET User Groupmeeting at the start of October was around what a unit test actually is.
I suppose the somewhat naive or simplistic definition is that it is just any test written using an xUnit framework such as NUnitor JUnit. However, integration or acceptance tests are often written using these frameworks so this definition doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold.
While discussing this last week a colleague came up with what I considered to be a very clear yet precise definition.</description>
