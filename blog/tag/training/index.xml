      <description>My colleague Charles and I attended Martin Odersky’s &amp;#39;Object-oriented meets functional: An exploration of Scala&amp;#39; two day Scala workshop hosted by Skills Matter at the end of last week.
It was run by Iulian Dragos who wrote his Phd thesis on how to improve the performance of the Scala compiler.
The course was a bit adapted from the original in that it came at Scala more from an application developer’s point of view rather than that of a language geek.</description>
