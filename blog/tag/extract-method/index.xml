      <description>Ever since I&amp;#8217;ve read Uncle Bob&amp;#8217;s Clean Code book my approach to coding has been all about the &#39;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtractMethod[extract method]&#39; refactoring - I pretty much look to extract method as much as I can until I get to the point where extracting another method would result in me just describing the language semantics in the method name.
 One of the approaches that I&amp;#8217;ve come across with regards to doing this refactoring is that it&amp;#8217;s only used when there is duplication of code and we want to reduce that duplication so that it&amp;#8217;s all in one place and then call that method from two places.</description>
