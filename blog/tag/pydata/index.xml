      <description>Over the last few days I attended PyData London 2018 and wanted to share my experience. The PyData series of conferences aim to bring together users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. I presented a talk on building a recommendation with Python and Neo4j at the 2016 version but didn&amp;#8217;t attend last year.
 The organisers said there were ~ 550 attendees spread over 1 day of tutorials and 2 days of talks.</description>
