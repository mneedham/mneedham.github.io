      <title>Pandas: Create matplotlib plot with x-axis label not index</title>

      <description>import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt   df = pd.DataFrame({ &#34;name&#34;: [&#34;Mark&#34;, &#34;Arya&#34;, &#34;Praveena&#34;], &#34;age&#34;: [34, 1, 31] }) df   This is what our DataFrame looks like:
 name age 0 Mark 34 1 Arya 31 2 Praveena 1   df.plot.bar() plt.tight_layout() plt.show()   If we run that code we&amp;#8217;ll see this chart:
   The chart itself looks fine, but the labels of the values on the x-axis are a bit weird.</description>

      <title>matplotlib - Create a histogram/bar chart for ratings/full numbers</title>

      <description>In my continued work with matplotlib I wanted to plot a histogram (or bar chart) for a bunch of star ratings to see how they were distributed.
 Before we do anything let&amp;#8217;s import matplotlib as well as pandas:
 import random import pandas as pd import matplotlib matplotlib.use(&#39;TkAgg&#39;) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.style.use(&#39;fivethirtyeight&#39;)   Next we&amp;#8217;ll create an array of randomly chosen star ratings between 1 and 5:</description>

      <description>In my last post I showed how to remove axes legends from a matplotlib chart, and while writing the post I actually had the change the code I used as my initial approach is now deprecated.
 As in the previous post, we&amp;#8217;ll first import pandas and matplotlib:
 import pandas as pd import matplotlib matplotlib.use(&#39;TkAgg&#39;) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.style.use(&#39;fivethirtyeight&#39;)   And we&amp;#8217;ll still use this DataFrame:
 df = pd.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working with matplotlib a bit recently, and I wanted to remove all axis legends from my chart. It took me a bit longer than I expected to figure it out so I thought I&amp;#8217;d write it up.
 Before we do anything let&amp;#8217;s import matplotlib as well as pandas, since we&amp;#8217;re going to plot data from a pandas DataFrame.
 import pandas as pd import matplotlib matplotlib.use(&#39;TkAgg&#39;) import matplotlib.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve previously written a couple of blog posts about my troubles getting matplotlib to play nicely and I run into a slightly different variant today while following Sidath Asiri&amp;#8217;s Hello World in TensorFlow tutorial.
 When I ran the script using a version of Python installed via virtualenv I got the following exception:
 Traceback (most recent call last): File &#34;iris.py&#34;, line 4, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; from matplotlib import pyplot as plt File &#34;</description>

      <title>Python 3: Create sparklines using matplotlib</title>

      <description>I recently wanted to create sparklines to show how some values were changing over time. In addition, I wanted to generate them as images on the server rather than introducing a JavaScript library.  Chris Seymour&#39;s excellent gist which shows how to create sparklines inside a Pandas dataframe got me most of the way there, but I had to tweak his code a bit to get it to play nicely with Python 3.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with some of the matplotlib demos recently and discovered that simply copying one of the examples didn&#39;t actually work for me. I was following the bar chart example and had the following code:
import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt N = 5 ind = np.arange(N) fig, ax = plt.subplots() menMeans = (20, 35, 30, 35, 27) menStd = (2, 3, 4, 1, 2) width = 0.</description>
