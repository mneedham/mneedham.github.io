      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve previously written a couple of blog posts about my troubles getting matplotlib to play nicely and I run into a slightly different variant today while following Sidath Asiri&amp;#8217;s Hello World in TensorFlow tutorial.
 When I ran the script using a version of Python installed via virtualenv I got the following exception:
 Traceback (most recent call last): File &#34;iris.py&#34;, line 4, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; from matplotlib import pyplot as plt File &#34;</description>

      <description>I recently wanted to create sparklines to show how some values were changing over time. In addition, I wanted to generate them as images on the server rather than introducing a JavaScript library.  Chris Seymour&#39;s excellent gist which shows how to create sparklines inside a Pandas dataframe got me most of the way there, but I had to tweak his code a bit to get it to play nicely with Python 3.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I was following The Marketing Technologist&#39;s content based recommender tutorial but ran into the following exception when trying to import the seaborn library: $ python 5_content_based_recommender/run.py Traceback (most recent call last): File &amp;quot;5_content_based_recommender/run.py&amp;quot;, line 14, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; import seaborn as sns File &amp;quot;/Users/markneedham/projects/themarketingtechnologist/tmt/lib/python2.7/site-packages/seaborn/__init__.py&amp;quot;, line 6, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; from .rcmod import * File &amp;quot;/Users/markneedham/projects/themarketingtechnologist/tmt/lib/python2.7/site-packages/seaborn/rcmod.py&amp;quot;, line 8, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; from . import palettes, _orig_rc_params File &amp;quot;/Users/markneedham/projects/themarketingtechnologist/tmt/lib/python2.7/site-packages/seaborn/palettes.py&amp;quot;, line 12, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; from .</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with some of the matplotlib demos recently and discovered that simply copying one of the examples didn&#39;t actually work for me. I was following the bar chart example and had the following code:
import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt N = 5 ind = np.arange(N) fig, ax = plt.subplots() menMeans = (20, 35, 30, 35, 27) menStd = (2, 3, 4, 1, 2) width = 0.</description>
