      <title>RSpec: Testing Rails routes</title>

      <description>Something which I keep forgetting is how to write controller tests where I want to check whether an action correctly redirected to another action.
With most of the routes in our application we&amp;rsquo;ve created a &amp;lsquo;resourceful route&amp;rsquo; where each action maps to a CRUD operation in the database.
We can do that with this type of code in routes.rb:
ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map| map.resources :foos end Several helper methods based on named rotes get created and included in our controllerswhen we do this and we have access to those inside our specs.</description>

      <description>We had an RSpec spec setup roughly like this the other day&amp;hellip;
describe &amp;#34;my stub test&amp;#34; do it &amp;#34;should be amazin&amp;#34; do Mark.stub!(:random).with(&amp;#34;some_wrong_argument&amp;#34;).and_return(&amp;#34;something&amp;#34;) Another.new.a_method end end &amp;hellip;where &amp;lsquo;Mark&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Another&amp;rsquo; were defined like so:
class Mark def self.random(params) &amp;#34;do some amazing stuff&amp;#34; end end class Another def a_method random = Mark.random(&amp;#34;foo&amp;#34;) # use random for something end end When we ran the spec we would get the following error message which was initially a little baffling:</description>

      <description>While testing some code that we were mixing into one of our controllers we made what I thought was an interesting mistake.
The module we wanted to test had some code a bit like this&amp;hellip;
module OurModule def some_method @User = User.find(params[:id]) # in the test code this is always true if @user == user ... end end end ..and we had the spec setup like so:
describe &amp;#39;OurController&amp;#39; do class TestController include OurModule attr_accessor :user end before(:each) do @controller = TestController.</description>

      <description>We have been using rspecon my project for the unit testing of our Ruby code and while running one of the specs last week I ended up getting this somewhat en-cryptic error message:
Invalid character &amp;#39;\240&amp;#39; in expression ... After convincing myself that this error wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually possible it turned out that I had somehow entered an &amp;lsquo;invisible to TextMate&amp;rsquo; character after one of the method definitions - on the editor it just looked like a space.</description>
