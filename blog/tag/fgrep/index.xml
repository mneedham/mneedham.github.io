      <description>We had a problem to solve earlier in the week where we wanted to try and find out which files we had ingested into our database based on a unique identifier.
We had a few hundred thousand files to search through to try and find the ones where around 50,000 identifiers were mentioned so that we could re-ingest them.
Running a normal grep for each identifier individually took a ridiculously long time so we needed to find a way to search for all of the identifiers at the same time to speed up the process.</description>
