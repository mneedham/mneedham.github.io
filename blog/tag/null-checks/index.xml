      <description>Having just flown half way across the world from Sydney to London I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how airport security is done and noticed a somewhat interesting link to the use of null checks in code.
In Sydney and Dubai airports my baggage and I were scanned only onceÂ before I was able to get onto the plane. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t scanned again when I went to the departure gate nor when I got onto the aircraft.</description>
