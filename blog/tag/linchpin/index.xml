      <description>I’ve read a couple of Seth Godin’s other books - Tribes and The Dip - and found them fairly readable so I figured his latest offering, Linchpin, would probably be worth a read too.
This is the first book that I’ve read on the iPad’s Kindle application and it was a reasonably good reading experience - I particularly like the fact that you can make notes and highlight certain parts of the text.</description>
