      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with plotting maps in R over the last week and got to the point where I wanted to have a google map in the background with a filled polygon on a shapefile in the foreground.
 The first bit is reasonably simple - we can just import the ggmap library and make a call to get_map:
 &amp;gt; library(ggmap) &amp;gt; sfMap = map = get_map(location = &#39;San Francisco&#39;, zoom = 12)     Next I wanted to show the outlines of the different San Francisco zip codes and came across a blog post by Paul Bidanset on Baltimore neighbourhoods which I was able to adapt.</description>
