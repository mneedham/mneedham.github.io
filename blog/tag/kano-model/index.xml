      <description>My colleague Jason Yip recently linked to the Kano Model and although it&amp;rsquo;s a theory about product development the definition of what counts as a product seems like it can be quite broad.
The best explanation of the model that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across so far is a post by Jean Claude Grosjean which Frankie linked me to.
Grosjean describes the three types of requirements like so:
Must Have (&amp;ldquo;Basic needs&amp;rdquo;) These are not always expressed but they are obvious to the customer and must be met&amp;hellip;[they] are not a source of satisfaction but can cause major disappointment.</description>
