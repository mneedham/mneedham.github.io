We have been using <a href="http://rspec.info/">rspec</a> on my project for the unit testing of our Ruby code and while running one of the specs last week I ended up getting this somewhat en-cryptic error message:


~~~text

Invalid character '\240' in expression
...
~~~

After convincing myself that this error wasn't actually possible it turned out that I had somehow entered an 'invisible to TextMate' character after one of the method definitions - on the editor it just looked like a space.

I'm not sure exactly what the character was but deleting it got rid of the error and got my test/spec running again.
