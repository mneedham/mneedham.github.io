title="IntelliJ style item tracking in Visual Studio"
tag=['intellij', 'visual-studio', 'net']

One of my favourite features of <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> is that it tracks the item that you currently have open on your Solution Explorer.

I thought this wasn't possible in Visual Studio and had resigned myself to trying to remember which project each file was in. Luckily for me a colleague pointed out that it is in fact possible but is just turned off by default.

Tools > Options > Projects and Solutions > Check 'Track Active Item in Solution Explorer'

Job done!
