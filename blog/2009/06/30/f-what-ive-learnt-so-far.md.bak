I did a presentation of some of the stuff that I've learnt from playing around with F# over the last six months or so at the most recent <a href="http://sydney.ozalt.net/2009/05/june-meeting-f.html">Alt.NET Sydney meeting</a>.

I've included the slides below but there was also some interesting discussion as well.

<ul>
<li>One of the questions asked was around how you would deal with code on a real project with regards to structuring it and ensuring that it was maintainable. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to this question as I haven't written any code in F# that's in production but there are certainly applications written n F# that are in production - the main one that I know a bit about is one which <a href="http://pandamonial.com/">Amanda Laucher</a> worked on <a href="http://vimeo.com/3555080">which she spoke about at the Alt.NET conference in Seattle</a>.</li>
<li>There was some discussion about dynamic v static languages - <a href="http://fragmental.tw/">Phil</a> spoke of not caring about what type something is rather caring about what it does. I pretty much agree with this and I think when using languages which have quite strong type inference such as F# (and more-so Haskell from what I hear) then I think we do move more towards that situation. </li>
<li><a href="http://erik.doernenburg.com">Erik</a> raised the point that functional languages aren't the solution for everything and I certainly feel it's niche is probably around operations with heavy data parsing/mining involved. I'm not sure I'd fancy doing an ASP.NET MVC application only in F# although I've seen some WPF code written using F# (unfortunately can't remember where) which looked reasonable so I'm not sure we should write it off just yet.</li>
</ul>

I've put the code that I walked through in the presentation on <a href="http://bitbucket.org/markhneedham/altnet-sydney-fsharp/changeset/dfcbc2acf486/">bitbucket</a>.
