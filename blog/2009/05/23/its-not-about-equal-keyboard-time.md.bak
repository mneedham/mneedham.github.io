My colleague <a href="http://ca.rroll.net">Nick Carroll</a> recently blogged some ideas about <a href="http://ca.rroll.net/2009/05/23/is-your-pair-hogging-the-keyboard/">what to do if your pair is hogging the keyboard</a>, suggesting using a timer which keeps track of how long each person has had at the keyboard as a useful way of ensuring that both people in the pair stay more engaged.

While I can see the thinking behind this I think it is addressing the wrong problem.
 
From my experience we don't always want to be moving the keyboard between the two people quickly at all times - I have certainly seen times where it makes sense for one person to be spending more time at the keyboard than the other.

A particular example of this is when there is a <strong>difference in experience between the two people</strong> at the particular skills required to complete the task they're working on.

On a project I worked on around 18 months ago I was struggling to stay engaged as the navigator as I didn't really understand what was going on and the half/half split in keyboard time wasn't really helping.

Chatting with a more experienced colleague about this at the time he suggested that when I paired with him he was perfectly happy to spend the majority of the time navigating while I drove so that I could get more understanding around the code base and become more useful to the team.

This colleague was clearly keeping the big picture in mind and I haven't come across a situation since then where someone acted so selflessly for the benefit of the team.

The lesson for me from this situation is that <strong>sometimes it makes sense for the person who can gain most from driving to do so</strong> more frequently.  

The other thing I think Nick's post is suggesting is that the only way for you to be engaged in a pair is when you are at the keyboard, which I don't believe to be correct.

The <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2008/02/14/pair-programming-the-non-driving-pair/">role of the navigator</a> shouldn't be underestimated as when it's done well it provides a very good complement to the person driving as that person is taking a bigger picture view of what the pair are working on and ensuring that the code being written is still fitting in with the rest of the system. Dahlia has <a href="http://dahliabock.wordpress.com/2009/05/23/pairing-what-to-do-when-youre-navigating/">written an informative post about some of the things that she does when navigating in a pair</a>.

Another idea <a href="http://dannorth.net/">Dan</a> suggested to me is to <strong>commentate on what you think is happening/what the other person is doing at the keyboard</strong> when you're navigating and feeling a bit lost.

I've spent quite a bit of time working with <a href="http://luning12.blogbus.com/">Lu Ning</a> on some Javascript on our project recently and have been trying out this approach there and I think it's helped me to understand things better although clearly it takes a lot of patience from the driver if you take this approach.
