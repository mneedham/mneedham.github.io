<p>I've been <a href="http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/">journalling</a> for almost 2 years now but some days I get stuck and can't think of anything to write about.</p>


<p>
I did a bit of searching to see if anybody had advice on solving this problem and found a few different articles:
</p>


<ul>

<li><a href="https://blog.doist.com/benefits-of-journaling-81b663a27608">The Productive Benefits of Journaling (plus 11 ideas for making the habit stick)</a></li>

<li><a href="https://medium.com/darius-foroux/read-this-if-you-want-to-keep-a-journal-but-dont-know-how-a3f081d360aa">Read This If You Want To Keep A Journal But Donâ€™t Know How</a></li>

<li><a href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/turn-pain-to-joy-11-tips-for-a-powerful-gratitude-journal/">Turn Pain to Joy: 11 Tips for a Powerful Gratitude Journal</a></li>

<li><a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal">Tips for Keeping a Gratitude Journal</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelwmiller/how-to-start-a-bullet-journal?utm_term=.vwdGL53Dp#.swwEzg5kD">WTF Is A Bullet Journal And Why Should You Start One? An Explainer</a></li>

</ul>

<p>
The articles talk about different approaches to journalling and since I'm not following one particular approach I thought I'd summarise all their ideas and put them in a document that I can use. I've also added some of my own ones.
</p>


<p>Here's the list:</p>


<ul>

<li>
Something you're grateful for
</li>
<li>
An unusual event
</li>
<li>
Goals or hopes
</li>
<li>
A past event
</li>
<li>
Things that are stopping you achieving your goals
</li>
<li>
Values that are important to you
</li>
<li>
Ideas or nagging thoughts
</li>
<li>
What did you do yesterday?
<ul>
<li>
What did you work on?
</li>
<li>
Who did you talk to?
</li>
<li>
What book did you read?
</li>
<li>
What podcasts did you listen to?
</li>
<li>
What TV shows/movies did you watch?
</li>
<li>
Where did you go?
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
What are you doing today?
</li>
<li>
What scares you?
</li>
<li>
Decisions you need to make/made - small or big
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you have any other ideas of what I can write about let me know in the comments. While researching for this post I noticed that Julia Cameron, the inventor of Morning Pages, has a new book out - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B073QXSCWC/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o00_?ie=UTF8&psc=1">The Right to Write: An Invitation and Initiation into the Writing Life</a> - so I'm hoping to get some ideas from there as well.
