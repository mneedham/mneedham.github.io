      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing with the Leaflet.js library over the Christmas holidays to visualise running routes drawn onto the map using a Polyline and I wanted to zoom the map the right amount to see all the points.
 Pre requisites We have the following HTML to define the div that will contain the map.
 &amp;lt;div id=&#34;container&#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div id=&#34;map&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; height: 100%&#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;   We also need to import the following Javascript and CSS files:</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to find an Ethereum Hello World example and came across Thomas Conté&amp;#8217;s excellent post that shows how to compile and deploy an Ethereum smart contract with solc and web3.
 In the latest version of web3 the API has changed to be based on promises so I decided to translate Thomas&#39; example.
 Let&amp;#8217;s get started.

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been journalling for almost 2 years now but some days I get stuck and can&amp;#8217;t think of anything to write about.
 I did a bit of searching to see if anybody had advice on solving this problem and found a few different articles:

      <description>In my last blog post I showed how to create a multi class classification ensemble using scikit-learn&amp;#8217;s http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#voting-classifier and finished mentioning that I didn&amp;#8217;t know which classifiers should be part of the ensemble.
 We need to get a better score with each of the classifiers in the ensemble otherwise they can be excluded.
 We have a TF/IDF based classifier as well as well as the classifiers I wrote about in the last post.</description>

      <description>For the Kaggle Spooky Author Identification I wanted to combine multiple classifiers together into an ensemble and found the VotingClassifier that does exactly that.
 We need to predict the probability that a sentence is written by one of three authors so the VotingClassifier needs to make a &#39;soft&#39; prediction. If we only needed to know the most likely author we could have it make a &#39;hard&#39; prediction instead.
 We start with three classifiers which generate different n-gram based features.</description>

      <description>In my continued exploration of Kaggle&amp;#8217;s Spooky Authors competition, I wanted to run a GridSearch turning on and off different classifiers to work out the best combination.
 I therefore needed to generate combinations of 1s and 0s enabling different classifiers.
 e.g. if we had 3 classifiers we&amp;#8217;d generate these combinations
 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1   where.</description>

      <description>I ran into an interesting Cypher error message earlier this week while trying to create an array property on a node which I thought I&amp;#8217;d share.
 This was the Cypher query I wrote:
 CREATE (:Person {id: [1, &#34;mark&#34;, 2.0]})   which results in this error:
 Neo.ClientError.Statement.TypeError Property values can only be of primitive types or arrays thereof.   We actually are storing an array of primitives but we have a mix of different types which isn&amp;#8217;t allowed.</description>

      <title>Python: Learning about defaultdict&#39;s handling of missing keys</title>

      <description>While reading the scikit-learn code I came across a bit of code that I didn&amp;#8217;t understand for a while but in retrospect is quite neat.
 This is the code snippet that intrigued me:
 vocabulary = defaultdict() vocabulary.default_factory = vocabulary.__len__   Let&amp;#8217;s quickly see how it works by adapting an example from scikit-learn:
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from collections import defaultdict &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vocabulary = defaultdict() &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vocabulary.default_factory = vocabulary.__len__ &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vocabulary[&#34;</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to improve my score on Kaggle&amp;#8217;s Spooky Author Identification competition, and my latest idea was building a model which used named entities extracted using the polyglot NLP library.
 We&amp;#8217;ll start by learning how to extract entities form a sentence using polyglot which isn&amp;#8217;t too tricky:
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from polyglot.text import Text &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; doc = &#34;My name is David Beckham. Hello from London, England&#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Text(doc, hint_language_code=&#34;en&#34;).entities [I-PER([&#39;David&#39;, &#39;Beckham&#39;]), I-LOC([&#39;London&#39;]), I-LOC([&#39;England&#39;])]   This sentence contains three entities.</description>

      <description>I wanted to use the polyglot NLP library that my colleague Will Lyon mentioned in his analysis of Russian Twitter Trolls but had installation problems which I thought I&amp;#8217;d share in case anyone else experiences the same issues.
 I started by trying to install polyglot:
 $ pip install polyglot ImportError: No module named &#39;icu&#39;   Hmmm I&amp;#8217;m not sure what icu is but luckily there&amp;#8217;s a GitHub issue covering this problem.</description>

 Neo4j Clusters on Kubernetes This posts assumes that we&amp;#8217;re familiar with deploying Neo4j on Kubernetes. I wrote an article on the Neo4j blog explaining this in more detail.
 The StatefulSet we create for our core servers require persistent storage, achieved via the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) primitive. A Neo4j cluster containing 3 core servers would have the following PVCs:</description>

      <description>I had a problem on a graph I was working on recently where I&amp;#8217;d managed to create duplicate nodes because I hadn&amp;#8217;t applied any unique constraints.
 I wanted to remove the duplicates, and came across Jimmy Ruts&#39; excellent post which shows some ways to do this.
 Let&amp;#8217;s first create a graph with some duplicate nodes to play with:
 UNWIND range(0, 100) AS id CREATE (p1:Person {id: toInteger(rand() * id)}) MERGE (p2:Person {id: toInteger(rand() * id)}) MERGE (p3:Person {id: toInteger(rand() * id)}) MERGE (p4:Person {id: toInteger(rand() * id)}) CREATE (p1)-[:KNOWS]-&amp;gt;(p2) CREATE (p1)-[:KNOWS]-&amp;gt;(p3) CREATE (p1)-[:KNOWS]-&amp;gt;(p4) Added 173 labels, created 173 nodes, set 173 properties, created 5829 relationships, completed after 408 ms.</description>

      <description>One of the first things I do after installing Neo4j is install the APOC library, but I find it&amp;#8217;s a bit of a manual process when spinning up a server on AWS so I wanted to simplify it a bit.
 There&amp;#8217;s already a Neo4j AMI which installs Neo4j 3.2.0 and my colleague Michael pointed out that we could download APOC into the correct folder by writing a script and sending it as UserData.</description>

 I created the following pair of lambdas that communicate with each other via an SNS topic.</description>

We want dynamicKey to be evaluated rather than treated as a literal. As usual, APOC comes to the rescue!</description>

 with &#34;8.37&#34; as rawNumeric RETURN toFloat(rawNumeric) * 1000000 AS numeric ╒═════════════════╕ │&#34;numeric&#34; │ ╞═════════════════╡ │8369999.999999999│ └─────────────────┘   Unfortunately that suffers from the classic rounding error when working with floating point numbers. I couldn&amp;#8217;t figure out a way to solve it using pure Cypher, but there tends to be an APOC function to solve every problem and this was no exception.</description>

      <description>In my continued work with Serverless and AWS Lambda I ran into a problem when trying to call a HTTP gateway.
 My project looked like this:
 serverless.yaml
 service: http-gateway frameworkVersion: &#34;&amp;gt;=1.2.0 &amp;lt;2.0.0&#34; provider: name: aws runtime: python3.6 timeout: 180 functions: no-op: name: NoOp handler: handler.noop events: - http: POST noOp   handler.py

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using the Serverless library to deploy and run some Python functions on AWS lambda recently and was initially confused about how to handle my dependencies.
 I tend to create a new virtualenv for each of my project so let&amp;#8217;s get that setup first:
 Prerequisites $ npm install serverless   $ virtualenv -p python3 a $ . a/bin/activate   Now let&amp;#8217;s create our Serverless project. I&amp;#8217;m going to install the requests library so that I can use it in my function.</description>

 The example in the documentation is written in PHP which I haven&amp;#8217;t done for about 10 years so I had to figure out how to do the same thing in Python.

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with Kaggle in my spare time over the last few weeks and came across an unexpected behaviour when trying to add a column to a dataframe.
 First let&amp;#8217;s get Panda&amp;#8217;s into our program scope:

      <description>In my continued playing around with the Kaggle house prices dataset I wanted to find any columns/fields that have null values in.
 If we want to get a count of the number of null fields by column we can use the following code, adapted from Poonam Ligade&amp;#8217;s kernel:
 Prerequisites import pandas as pd     Count the null columns train = pd.read_csv(&#34;train.csv&#34;) null_columns=train.columns[train.isnull().any()] train[null_columns].isnull().sum()   LotFrontage 259 Alley 1369 MasVnrType 8 MasVnrArea 8 BsmtQual 37 BsmtCond 37 BsmtExposure 38 BsmtFinType1 37 BsmtFinType2 38 Electrical 1 FireplaceQu 690 GarageType 81 GarageYrBlt 81 GarageFinish 81 GarageQual 81 GarageCond 81 PoolQC 1453 Fence 1179 MiscFeature 1406 dtype: int64   So there are lots of different columns containing null values.</description>

      <description>I recently needed to generate a string with comma separated values, based on iterating a range of numbers.
 e.g. we should get the following output where n = 3
 foo-0,foo-1,foo-2   I only had the shell available to me so I couldn&amp;#8217;t shell out into Python or Ruby for example. That means it&amp;#8217;s bash scripting time!
 If we want to iterate a range of numbers and print them out on the screen we can write the following code:</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a blog post a couple of weeks ago, I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with the Kaggle House Prices competition and the most recent thing I tried was training a random forest regressor.
 Unfortunately, although it gave me better results locally it got a worse score on the unseen data, which I figured meant I&amp;#8217;d overfitted the model.
 I wasn&amp;#8217;t really sure how to work out if that theory was true or not, but by chance I was reading Chris Albon&amp;#8217;s blog and found a post where he explains how to inspect the importance of every feature in a random forest.</description>

      <description>When running Kubernetes on a cloud provider, rather than locally using minikube, it&amp;#8217;s useful to know which node a pod is running on.
 The normal command to list pods doesn&amp;#8217;t contain this information:
 $ kubectl get pod NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE neo4j-core-0 1/1 Running 0 6m neo4j-core-1 1/1 Running 0 6m neo4j-core-2 1/1 Running 0 2m   I spent a while searching for a command that I could use before I came across Ta-Ching Chen&amp;#8217;s blog post while looking for something else.</description>

   Neo4j sponsored the conference as we&amp;#8217;ve been experimenting with building a GraphQL to Neo4j integration and wanted to get some feedback from the community as well as learn what&amp;#8217;s going on in GraphQL land.
 Will and Michael have written about their experience where they talk more about the hackathon we hosted so I&amp;#8217;ll cover it more from a personal perspective.</description>

      <description>In my last post I showed how to load and query data from the Strava API in PostgreSQL and after executing some simple queries my next task was to query more complex part of the JSON structure.
   Strava allows users to create segments, which are edited portions of road or trail where athletes can compete for time.
 I wanted to write a query to find all the times that I&amp;#8217;d run a particular segment.</description>

      <description>In my last post I showed how to map Strava runs using data that I&amp;#8217;d extracted from their https://strava.github.io/api/v3/activities/ API, but the API returns a lot of other data that I discarded because I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure what I should keep.
 The API returns a nested JSON structure so the easiest solution would be to save each run as an individual file but I&amp;#8217;ve always wanted to try out PostgreSQL&amp;#8217;s JSON data type and this seemed like a good opportunity.</description>

 To achieve that in AWS Lambda land we need to create a CloudWatch Event. The documentation describes them as follows:
  Using simple rules that you can quickly set up, you can match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently upgraded to Python 3 (I know, took me a while!) and realised that one of my scripts that writes JSON to a file no longer works!
 This is a simplified version of what I&amp;#8217;m doing:
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import json &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = {&#34;mark&#34;: {&#34;name&#34;: &#34;Mark&#34;}, &#34;michael&#34;: {&#34;name&#34;: &#34;Michael&#34;} } &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; json.dumps(x.values()) Traceback (most recent call last): File &#34;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&#34;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; File &#34;/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.0/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/json/__init__.py&#34;, line 231, in dumps return _default_encoder.</description>

      <description>I often find myself wanting to convert date strings into Unix timestamps using Neo4j&amp;#8217;s APOC library and unfortunately some sources don&amp;#8217;t use the format that apoc.date.parse expects.
 e.g.
 return apoc.date.parse(&#34;2012-11-12T08:46:15Z&#34;,&#39;s&#39;) AS ts Failed to invoke function `apoc.date.parse`: Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: java.text.ParseException: Unparseable date: &#34;2012-11-12T08:46:15Z&#34;   We need to define the format explicitly so the SimpleDataFormat documentation comes in handy. I tried the following:
 return apoc.date.parse(&#34;2012-11-12T08:46:15Z&#34;,&#39;s&#39;,&#34;yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ&#34;) AS ts Failed to invoke function `apoc.</description>

      <description>Over the last few days I&amp;#8217;ve been watching the chain of &#39;My name is...&#39; tweets kicked off by DHH with interest. As I understand it, the idea is to show that coding interview riddles/hard tasks on a whiteboard are ridiculous.
  Hello, my name is David. I would fail to write bubble sort on a whiteboard. I look code up on the internet all the time. I don&amp;#39;t do riddles.</description>

      <title>Neo4j: How do null values even work?</title>

      <description>Every now and then I find myself wanting to import a CSV file into Neo4j and I always get confused with how to handle the various null values that can lurk within.
 Let&amp;#8217;s start with an example that doesn&amp;#8217;t have a CSV file in sight. Consider the following list and my attempt to only return null values:
 WITH [null, &#34;null&#34;, &#34;&#34;, &#34;Mark&#34;] AS values UNWIND values AS value WITH value WHERE value = null RETURN value (no changes, no records)   Hmm that&amp;#8217;s weird.</description>

      <description>Last week we ran our first online meetup for several years and I wanted to wanted to analyse the stats that YouTube lets you download for an event.
 The file I downloaded looked like this:

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with ReactJS and the Material-UI library over the weekend and ran into this error while trying to follow one of the example from the demo application:
 ERROR in ./src/app/modules/Foo.js Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve module &#39;material-ui/lib/Subheader&#39; in /Users/markneedham/neo/reactjs-test/src/app/modules @ ./src/app/modules/Foo.js 13:17-53 webpack: Failed to compile.   This was the component code:
 import React from &#39;react&#39; import Subheader from &#39;material-ui/lib/Subheader&#39; export default React.createClass({ render() { return &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Subheader&amp;gt;Some Text&amp;lt;/Subheader&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; } })   which is then rendered like this:</description>

      <description>As part of a Go script I&amp;#8217;ve been working on I wanted to write to a CSV file from multiple Go routines, but realised that the built in CSV Writer isn&amp;#8217;t thread safe.
 My first attempt at writing to the CSV file looked like this:
 package main import ( &#34;encoding/csv&#34; &#34;os&#34; &#34;log&#34; &#34;strconv&#34; ) func main() { csvFile, err := os.Create(&#34;/tmp/foo.csv&#34;) if err != nil { log.Panic(err) } w := csv.</description>

      <description>As part of a recommendations with Neo4j talk that I&amp;#8217;ve presented a few times over the last year I have a set of scripts that download some data from the meetup.com API.
 They&amp;#8217;re all written in Python but I thought it&amp;#8217;d be a fun exercise to see what they&amp;#8217;d look like in Go. My eventual goal is to try and parallelise the API calls.
 This is the Python version of the script:</description>
