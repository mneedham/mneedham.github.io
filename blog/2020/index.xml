      <description>For our first QuickGraph of the new decade we&amp;#8217;re going to explore data from the Official UK Top 40 Chart. This chart ranks the top 100 songs of the week based on official sales of sales of downloads, CD, vinyl, audio streams and video streams. Every week BBC Radio 1 broadcast the top 40 songs, which explains the name of the chart.
  Figure 1. The Official UK Charts  Scraping the Official Charts I couldn&amp;#8217;t find a dump of the dataset, so we&amp;#8217;re going to use our web scraping skills again.</description>

      <description>draft = false date=&#34;2020-01-02 00:21:00&#34; title=&#34;Spotify API: Making my first call&#34; tag=[&#39;spotify&#39;, &#39;python&#39;, &#39;apis&#39;] category=[&#39;Spotify&#39;] description=&#34;Learn how to call the Spotify API to retrieve details about a particular song.&#34; image=&#34;uploads/2020/01/spotify-logo.png&#34;  I wanted to enrich the data for a little music application I&amp;#8217;m working on and realised it would be a perfect opportunity to try out the Spotify API. I want to extract data about individual tracks (via the Tracks API), but before we do that we&amp;#8217;ll need to create an app and have it approved for access to the Spotify API.</description>
