I've been using Vim instead of <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/index.html">RubyMine</a> for the last month or so and it's been interesting observing the way that I browse code as I add plugins to make my life easier.

<h3>Between files</h3>
I generally don't know exactly where in the folder structure different files live since I'm used to being able to search by just the name i.e. RubyMine's Ctrl-N 

<a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/">Yahuda Katz wrote a blog post</a> earlier in the year where he listed some of the plugins he's been using - one of which is called <a href="https://wincent.com/products/command-t">Command-T</a> and allows exactly this functionality.

I also quite like the ability to quickly access files that I've recently opened i.e. files which are in the Vim buffer or RubyMine's Ctrl-E. The <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1984">FuzzyFinder</a> plugin provides that functionality.

I've also tagged all my Ruby gems and the source code of the project using <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">Exuberant CTags</a> which then allows <a href="http://blog.bojica.com/2010/06/27/ctags-and-vim-for-ruby-on-rails-development">easy browsing to methods/classes</a>.

<h3>Inside files</h3>

I've noticed that the way I browse inside files has changed since I started using Vim.

I used to just scroll around files using the mouse but now I find myself moving around a file by line numbers instead.

A lot of the commands for file editing in Vim are based on moving/changing/deleting to a particular symbol so you become almost a human parser when reading a line of text.

I found/am finding the following quite useful for learning Vim shortcuts:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif">Vim cheat sheet</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tnerual.eriogerg.free.fr/vimqrc.pdf">Vim quick reference card</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jmcpherson.org/editing.html">Efficient Editing with Vim</a></li>
</ul>

When coding in Java/C# I rely quite heavily on auto complete to tell me what methods I have available to me on a certain object.

Although I don't use it that frequently the <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=182">SuperTab</a> plugin works reasonably well when you do need help.

<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/just3ws">Mike</a> pointed out <a href="https://github.com/spicycode/Vimlander-2-The-Quickening">Vimlander-2-The-Quickening</a> which has some of the plugins I mentioned and several others ready to use.
