My colleague <a href="http://www.wikyblog.com/AmanKing/">Aman King</a> is back in Pune for the time being and during one of our conversations he was asking me why I didn't wait a bit longer and learn more about Ruby before writing about it.

In a way he is right and I didn't write anything at all about C# or Java when I was first learning how to write code in those languages because I didn't have the confidence to write about something that I knew nothing about.

However, what I found when I was initially learning <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/category/dotnet/f-dotnet/">F#</a> was that even writing about very basic things was quite useful to me and once I'd written about something my understanding of it tended to increase.

For example about a year and a half ago I wrote a post about <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2009/05/02/f-stuff-i-get-confused-about/">some common things that I'd been getting confused with</a> and I was quite surprised to notice that I never confused them again once I'd written that post.

I'm not sure of the science which explains why that happens but I've noticed a similar thing happening with Ruby. 

I wrote about the advantages of <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2009/04/21/learning-through-teaching/">learning through teaching</a> last year which is along similar lines and I think the points I made there are applicable even if the subject matter would be trivial for others.

The other useful side effect which sometimes happens is that <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2010/10/16/ruby-hash-default-value/">someone much better than me will point out a better way of doing something</a> than what I described and I can then use their approach in code I write in the future.

In a somewhat related article titled '<a href="http://www.wordyard.com/2010/10/08/blogging-empowerment-and-the-adjacent-possible/">Blogging, empowerment, and the “adjacent possible”</a>' Scott Rosenberg recently described in more depth how writing about things can actually change the way we think about them.
