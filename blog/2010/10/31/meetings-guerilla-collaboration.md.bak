As I've mentioned on twitter a few times my current team has a lot of meetings and apart from using the passive aggressive approach that <a href="http://tobytripp.github.com/meeting-ticker/">Toby Tripp's meeting ticker</a> provides I've also been flicking through Chapter 19, 'Guerilla Collaboration', of Jean Tabaka's '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Collaboration-Explained-Facilitation-Software-Project/dp/0321268776/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1288536162&sr=8-1">Collaboration Explained: Facilitation skills for software project leaders</a>' which gives other ideas.

I've also seen some useful ideas that my colleagues have used in meetings that I've been part of.

<h3>Agenda/Purpose of the meeting</h3>
Jean suggests that we ask the meeting organiser for an agenda in order to ensure that:

<ul>
<li>We aren't wasting the time of some participants</li>
<li>We aren't missing any important attendees</li>
<li>The meeting has a focus and people aren't at a loss for what to do</li>
</ul>

I've noticed the 1st and 3rd of these happening more frequently and it's typically because the topic of the meeting is very generic which means that anything goes!

<h3>Time Check</h3>
Calling for a time check is useful for helping ensure that the time in the meeting is being used effectively and that the meeting doesn't over run the allocated time.

Having a start and end time for the meeting is also useful because otherwise a meeting can drift on for hours without any conclusion. 

Creating a constraint - of time in this case - helps to keep things a bit more focused and <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2010/08/16/creativity-john-cleese/">in theory could lead to move creativity</a>.

<h3>Keeping the discussion on track</h3>
This is typically easier for the meeting facilitator to do but it's certainly possible for an attendee to ask whether a certain discussion is relevant or if it can be taken offline.

I find that discussions can often drift into implementation detail i.e. the <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2010/10/25/communication-logging-levels/">wrong logging level</a> and <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2010/10/09/agile-the-curse-of-meetings/">totally isolate the majority of the meeting's participants</a>.

It's certainly important to be careful when doing this because you might be wrong about what 'on track' means and people can quickly stop contributing if you consistently shut them down.

<h3>Parking lot</h3>
This would typically just be a section of the whiteboard used to 'park' discussions about topics which we can get to later but aren't part of the purpose of the meeting.

I haven't seen this used that often but it seems like a useful technique because it still acknowledges that someone has a valid point, just that it's not for discussion at the moment.
