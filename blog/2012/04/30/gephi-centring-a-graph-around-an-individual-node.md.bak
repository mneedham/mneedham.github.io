I spent some time recently playing around with <a href="http://gephi.org/">gephi</a> - an open source platform for creating visualisations of graphs - to get a bit more insight into the ThoughtWorks graph which I've created in neo4j.

I <a href="http://maxdemarzi.com/2012/04/12/using-sigma-js-with-neo4j/">followed Max De Marxi's blog post</a> to create a GEFX (Graph Exchange XML Format) file to use in gephi although I later learned that you can import directly from neo4j into gephi which I haven't tried yet.

I loaded it into gephi and this is what it looks like:

<div>
<img src="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/full-graph.jpg" alt="Full graph" title="full-graph.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="530" />
</div>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/filter-menu-top.jpg" alt="Filter menu top" title="filter-menu-top.jpg" border="0" width="270" height="438" />
</div>

There are massive numbers of connections between almost every node so it's pretty hard to see what's going on.

I wanted to be able to centre the graph around an individual person and see just the links related to them.

To do that we need to make use of an '<a href="http://forum.gephi.org/viewtopic.php?t=286">ego</a> <a href="http://blog.ouseful.info/2010/05/10/getting-started-with-gephi-network-visualisation-app-%E2%80%93-my-facebook-network-part-iii-ego-filters-and-simple-network-stats/">filter</a>' so the first step is to make the filters menu visible by clicking 'Window > Filters'. 

We can then choose the ego filter which sits under 'Library > Topology' and fill in the ID of the node that we want to centre the graph around as well as choose the depth of the traversal.

<div>
<img src="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/filter-menu-bottom.jpg" alt="Filter menu bottom" title="filter-menu-bottom.jpg" border="0" width="257" height="185" />
</div>


In this case any traversal above 1 will end up traversing the majority of the graph since the average distance between nodes in this graph is just above 2.5.

I run the 'Force Atlas' layout algorithm over it and this is what we end up with:

<div>
<img src="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/my-graph.jpg" alt="My graph" title="my-graph.jpg" border="0" width="545" height="479" />
</div>

My graph shows some interesting clustering of nodes where the ones on the right are people I worked with in India, top left are people I worked with in Australia, bottom left people in the UK and the ones towards the lower middle are people I went to ThoughtWorks University with.

There are a load of other filters to choose from but the ego filter is pretty cool!
