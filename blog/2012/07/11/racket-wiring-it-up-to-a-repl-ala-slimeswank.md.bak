title="Racket: Wiring it up to a REPL ala SLIME/Swank"
tag=['scheme']
category=['Software Development']

One of the awesome things about working with clojure is that it's possible to wire up clojure files in emacs to a REPL by making use of <a href="http://www.beaconhill.com/solutions/kb/clojure/setting-up-clojure-with-slime-on-ubuntu.html">Slime</a>/<a href="https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure">Swank</a>.

I've started using <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> to work through the examples in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Little-Schemer-Daniel-Friedman/dp/0262560992/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1342034533&sr=8-1">The Little Schemer</a> and wanted to achieve a similar thing there.

<blockquote>
Racket is a modern programming language in the Lisp/Scheme family, suitable for a wide range of applications
</blockquote>

I don't know much about configuring emacs so I made use of Phil Halgelberg's <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">emacs-starter-kit which is available on github</a>.

On my travels I came across <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zev99LT-k70">this video describing how to do exactly what I wanted</a>.

The first step was to download a library called '<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/">geiser</a>':

<blockquote>
Geiser is a generic Emacs/Scheme interaction mode, featuring an enhanced REPL and a set of minor modes improving Emacs' basic scheme major mode.
</blockquote>

The easiest way seemed to be to clone the git repository:


~~~text

git clone git://gitorious.org/geiser/mainline.git geiser
~~~

I then added the following line to my <cite>/Users/mneedham.emacs.d/init.el</cite> file:


~~~text

(load "/Users/mneedham/github/geiser/elisp/geiser.el")
~~~

From emacs you then need to run the following command:


~~~text

M-x geiser
~~~

It then asks you which scheme implementation you want to use, so in our case we need to make sure that racket is available on the path.

For some reason when I downloaded racket it seemed to prefer mounting itself as a volume rather than installing itself to /Applications so I ended up copy/pasting the folder to my home directory and adding it to the PATH in my <cite>.bashrc</cite>:


~~~text

export PATH=$PATH:"/Users/mneedham/Documents/Racket v5.2.1/bin"
~~~

Now we can just type 'racket' when we're asked which scheme implementation we want and then we're done!
