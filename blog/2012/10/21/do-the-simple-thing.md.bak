One of the most unexpected things that I picked up while pairing with <a href="https://twitter.com/a5hok">Ashok</a> for a few days in August/September is his ability to <strong>pick the simplest solution</strong> when confronted with a problem.

On numerous occasions we'd be trying to do something and I'd end up on a yak shaving mission trying to get a complicated approach to work while he watched on with bemusement.

I thought I'd actually learnt this lesson from working with Ashok but on a couple of occasions over the last week I've caught myself doing the same thing again!

A couple of days ago I wanted to send a photo taken on my phone to someone but the photo was about 2MB in size, I couldn't get the wireless network in the office to work and attempting to send it via 3G was totally failing.

I somehow found myself trying to debug the problem with the wireless network when <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/shodhan-sheth/2/277/287">Shodhan</a> pointed out that I could just transfer the file via USB to my machine and then email it from there.

To add to my shame, earlier this evening I was trying to help my mum get a song from a CD onto the hard drive and somehow found myself trying to compile <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/download.html">ffmeg</a> so that I could convert an AIFF file into an MP3 on my Mac.

In actual fact all I needed to do was rip the CD using Windows Media Player which somehow had completely skipped by mind until <a href="https://twitter.com/jennifersmithco">Jen</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV2wkX0InBk">YouTube</a> led me to that solution at the same time.

In retrospect I can't believe I actually believed that what I was doing was a good solution to the problem but some part of my brain clearly though it was!

Although both this examples are on the periphery of software development I think it's very easy to fall into the same trap there - <strong>we want to use things that we've learned to come up with clever solutions</strong> but that cleverness isn't always useful!
