title="Mac OS X: Removing Byte Order Mark with an editor"

About a month ago I wrote about <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2012/09/03/a-rogue-357273277-utf-8-byte-order-mark/">some problems I was having working with Windows generated CSV files</a> which had a Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the file and I described a way to get rid of it using awk.

It's a bit of a long winded process though and I always forget what the parameters I need to pass to awk are so I thought it would probably be quicker if I could just work out a way to get rid of the BOM using an editor.

I'm using a Mac so the most popular hex editor on that platform seems to be <a href="http://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/">HexFiend</a>.

If we open the problematic file with that it's reasonably easy to see where the BOM is and we can then manually remove it.

There is a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2160405/hex-editor-for-mac-osx">list of other hex editors for the Mac on this Stack Overflow thread</a>.

I figured there was probably a way to do this using emacs and indeed there is! 

One way is to open the file using 'Meta-X find-file-literally' which displays all non ASCII characters so that you can delete them if you want:

I also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3859274/removing-byte-order-marks-boms-using-emacs">learnt about another way</a> which is to first open the file using 'Ctrl X Ctrl F' and then run 'Meta-X set-buffer-file-encoding-system' and enter 'utf-8' before saving the file. The BOM will now be deleted!

This is perhaps a bit simpler since you don't need to delete the characters manually.

There is a <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/39786/in-emacs-or-other-editor-how-to-display-the-byte-offset-of-the-cursor">third way where you open the file using 'Meta X hexl-find-file'</a> but it seems more difficult to use than the other two options!
