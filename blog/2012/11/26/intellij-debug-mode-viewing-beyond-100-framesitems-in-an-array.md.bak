title="IntelliJ Debug Mode: Viewing beyond 100 frames/items in an array"

In my continued attempts at the <a href="">Kaggle Digit Recognizer</a> problem I've been playing around with the <a href="http://www.heatonresearch.com/wiki/Encog_Java_Examples">encog</a> library to try and build a neural networks solution to the problem.

Unfortunately it's not quite working at the moment so I wanted to debug the code and see whether the input parameters were being correctly translated from the CSV file.

Each input is an array containing 784 values but by default IntelliJ restricts you to seeing 100 elements which wasn't helpful in my case since the early values tend to all be 0 and it's not until you get half way through that you see different values:

It's <a href="http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2011/09/debugger-working-with-sub-ranges-for-arrays-and-lists/">actually relatively easy</a> to see the other values by right clicking on the array in question and clicking 'Adjust Range':

Then I type in the end index of the array and we're done!
