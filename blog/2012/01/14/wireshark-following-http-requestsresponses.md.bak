I like using <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> to have a look at the traffic going across different interfaces but because it shows what's happening across the wire by the packet it's quite difficult to tell what a request/response looked like.

I've been playing around with <a href="https://github.com/caelum/restfulie-java">restfulie</a>/<a href="http://vraptor.caelum.com.br/">Vraptor</a> today so I wanted to be able to see the request/response pair when something wasn't working.

I didn't know it was actually possible but <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2163636/mapping-http-requests-to-http-responses">this post on StackOverflow describes how</a>.

First we need to select the row which contains any part of our request/response - in this case I just selected the row representing the request - and then we go to the Analyze menu and click 'Follow TCP Stream':

</div>

We can then see the requests/responses which happened all next to each other:

<div align="center">
<img src="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/show_stream.jpg" alt="Show stream" title="show_stream.jpg" border="0" width="500" height="390" />
</div>

The keyboard shortcut to get to that menu is 'Alt-A F' but for some reason the 'Alt' key wasn't working for me by default so I had to follow the <a href="http://francisnorth.blogspot.com/2009/07/how-to-get-alt-key-to-function-properly.html">instructions on Francis North's blog</a> to get it working.
