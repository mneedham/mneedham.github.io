I wanted to make a change to add <cite>flatMap</cite> to <cite>Option</cite> in <a href="https://code.google.com/p/totallylazy/">totallylazy</a> so I had to <a href="https://code.google.com/r/mhneedham-totally-lazy/">clone the repository</a> and make the change.

I thought I'd then be able to just push the change using my Google user name and password but instead ended up with the following error:


~~~text

It turns out that you need to specifically set an option to use your Google account from the <a href="https://code.google.com/hosting/settings">settings page</a>:

And then it works!
