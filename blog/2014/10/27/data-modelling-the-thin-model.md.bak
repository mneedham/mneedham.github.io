<p>About a third of the way through <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mastering-Data-Modeling-Driven-Approach/dp/020170045X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1414364532&sr=8-1&keywords=mastering+data+modeling">Mastering Data Modeling</a> the authors describe common data modelling mistakes and one in particular resonated with me - '<strong>Thin LDS, Lost Users</strong>'.</p>


<p>LDS stands for 'Logical Data Structure' which is a diagram depicting what kinds of data some person or group wants to remember. In other words, a tool to help derive the <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2014/10/06/conceptual-model-vs-graph-model/">conceptual model</a> for our domain.</p>


<p>
They describe the problem that a thin model can cause as follows:
</p>


<blockquote>
[...] within 30 minutes [of the modelling session] the users were lost...we determined that the model was too thin. That is, many entities had just identifying descriptors. 

While this is syntactically okay, when we revisited those entities asking, <em>What else is memorable here?</em> the users had lots to say. 

When there was flesh on the bones, the uncertainty abated and the session took a positive course.
</blockquote>

<p>I found myself making the same mistake a couple of weeks ago during a graph modelling session. I tend to spend the majority of the time focused on the relationships between the bits of data and treat the meta data or attributes almost as an after thought.</p>

</div>

<p>The nice thing about the graph model is that it encourages an iterative approach so I was quickly able to bring the model to life and the domain experts back onside.</p>


<p>We can see a simple example of adding flesh to a model with a subset of the movies graph.</p>
 

<p>We might start out with the model on the right hand side which just describes the structure of the graph but doesn't give us very much information about the entities.</p>


<p>I tend to sketch out the structure of all the data before adding any attributes but I think some people find it easier to follow if you add at least some flesh before moving on to the next part of the model.</p>


<p>In our next iteration of the movie graph we can add attributes to the actor and movie:</p>

</div>

<p>We can then go on to evolve the model further but the lesson for me is <strong>value the attributes more</strong>, it's not all about the structure.</p>
