<p>Earlier in the year I wrote a <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2014/04/07/install4j-and-applescript-creating-a-mac-os-x-application-bundle-for-a-java-application/">blog post showing how to build a Mac OS X DMG file for a Java application</a> and I recently revisited this script to update it to a new version and ran into a frustrating error message.</p>
 

<p>I tried to run the following command to create a new DMG file from a source folder...</p>



~~~text

$ hdiutil create -volname "DemoBench" -size 100m -srcfolder dmg/ -ov -format UDZO pack.temp.dmg
~~~

<p>...but was met with the following error message:



~~~text

...could not access /Volumes/DemoBench/DemoBench.app/Contents/Resources/app/database-agent.jar - Operation canceled

hdiutil: create failed - Operation canceled
~~~

<p>I was initially a bit stumped and thought maybe the flags to hdiutil had changed but a quick look at the man page suggested that wasn't the issue.</p>


<p>I decided to go back to my pre command line approach for creating a DMG - DiskUtility - and see if I could create it that way. This helped reveal the actual problem:</p>

</div>

<p>I increased the volume size to 150 MB...</p>



~~~text

$ hdiutil create -volname "DemoBench" -size 150m -srcfolder dmg/ -ov -format UDZO pack.temp.dmg
~~~

<p>and all was well:</p>

<p>And this post will serve as documentation to stop it catching me out next time!</p>
