<p>A few weeks ago we ran a <cite><a href="http://www.meetup.com/graphdb-london/events/179211972/">build your first Neo4j app</a></cite> meetup in the Neo4j London office during which we worked with the meta data around <a href="http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digital-scholarship/2013/12/a-million-first-steps.html">1 million images recently released into the public domain by the British Library</a>.</p>


<p>Feedback from previous meetups had indicated that attendees wanted to practice modelling a domain from scratch and understand the options for importing said model into the database. This data set seemed perfect for this purpose.</p>


<p>We started off by scanning the data set and coming up with some potential questions we could ask of it and then the group split in two and came up with a graph model:</p>

</div>

<p>Having spent 15 minutes working on that, one person from each group explained the process they'd gone through to all attendees.</p>


<p>Each group took a similar approach whereby they scanned a subset of the data, sketched out all the properties and then discussed whether or not something should be a node, relationship or property in a graph model.</p>


<p>We then spent a bit of time tweaking the model so we had one everyone was happy with.</p>


<p>We split into three groups to work on input. One group imported some of the data by generating cypher statements from Java, one imported data using <a href="http://book.py2neo.org/en/latest/">py2neo</a> and the last group imported data using the <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/batchinsert.html">batch inserter</a>.</p>


<p>You can have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/mneedham/neo4j-bl">github repository</a> to see what we got up and specifically the <cite><a href="https://github.com/mneedham/neo4j-bl/tree/solution">solution</a></cite> branch to see the batch inserter code and the <cite><a href="https://github.com/mneedham/neo4j-bl/tree/cypher-import">cypher-import</a></cite> branch for the cypher based approach.</p>


<p>The approach we used throughout the session is quite similar to a <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2011/03/29/thoughtworks-university-coding-dojo-style/">Kake coding dojo</a> - something I first tried out when I was a trainer at ThoughtWorks University.</p>


<p>Although there were a few setup based things that could have been a bit slicker I think this format worked reasonably well and we'll use something similar at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/graphdb-london/events/181676642/">next version in a couple of weeks time</a>.</p>
 

<p>Feel free to come along if it sounds interesting!</p>
