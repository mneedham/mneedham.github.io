<p>In my spare time I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/mneedham/neo4j-meetup">a Neo4j application that runs on tops of meetup.com's API</a> and Nicole recently showed me how I could wire up some of the queries to <a href="http://nicolewhite.github.io/2014/05/30/demo-of-rneo4j-part1.html">use her Rneo4j library</a>: </p>

<p>The query used in that visualisation shows the number of members that overlap between each pair of groups but a more interesting query is the one which shows the % overlap between groups based on the unique members across the groups.</p>


<p>The query is a bit more complicated than the original:</p>



~~~cypher

MATCH (group1:Group), (group2:Group)
OPTIONAL MATCH (group1)<-[:MEMBER_OF]-()-[:MEMBER_OF]->(group2)

WITH group1, group2, COUNT(*) as commonMembers
MATCH (group1)<-[:MEMBER_OF]-(group1Member)

WITH group1, group2, commonMembers, COLLECT(id(group1Member)) AS group1Members
MATCH (group2)<-[:MEMBER_OF]-(group2Member)

WITH group1, group2, commonMembers, group1Members, COLLECT(id(group2Member)) AS group2Members
WITH group1, group2, commonMembers, group1Members, group2Members

UNWIND(group1Members + group2Members) AS combinedMember
WITH DISTINCT group1, group2, commonMembers, combinedMember

WITH group1, group2, commonMembers, COUNT(combinedMember) AS combinedMembers

RETURN group1.name, group2.name, toInt(round(100.0 * commonMembers / combinedMembers)) AS percentage		 
ORDER BY group1.name, group1.name
~~~

<p>The next step is to wire that up to use Rneo4j and ggplot2. First we'll get the libraries installed and loaded:</p>



~~~r

install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nicolewhite/Rneo4j")
install.packages("ggplot2")

library(Rneo4j)
library(ggplot2)
~~~

<p>And now we'll execute the query and create a chart from the results:</p>



~~~r

graph = startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/")

query = "MATCH (group1:Group), (group2:Group)
         WHERE group1 <> group2
         OPTIONAL MATCH p = (group1)<-[:MEMBER_OF]-()-[:MEMBER_OF]->(group2)
         WITH group1, group2, COLLECT(p) AS paths
         RETURN group1.name, group2.name, LENGTH(paths) as commonMembers
         ORDER BY group1.name, group2.name"

group_overlap = cypher(graph, query)

ggplot(group_overlap, aes(x=group1.name, y=group2.name, fill=commonMembers)) + 
geom_bin2d() +
geom_text(aes(label = commonMembers)) +
labs(x= "Group", y="Group", title="Member Group Member Overlap") +
scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high="red") +
theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12, color = "black"),
      axis.title = element_text(size = 14, color = "black"),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 16, color = "black"),
      axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))

// as percentage

query = "MATCH (group1:Group), (group2:Group)
         WHERE group1 <> group2
         OPTIONAL MATCH path = (group1)<-[:MEMBER_OF]-()-[:MEMBER_OF]->(group2)

         WITH group1, group2, COLLECT(path) AS paths

         WITH group1, group2, LENGTH(paths) as commonMembers
         MATCH (group1)<-[:MEMBER_OF]-(group1Member)

         WITH group1, group2, commonMembers, COLLECT(id(group1Member)) AS group1Members
         MATCH (group2)<-[:MEMBER_OF]-(group2Member)

         WITH group1, group2, commonMembers, group1Members, COLLECT(id(group2Member)) AS group2Members
         WITH group1, group2, commonMembers, group1Members, group2Members

         UNWIND(group1Members + group2Members) AS combinedMember
         WITH DISTINCT group1, group2, commonMembers, combinedMember

         WITH group1, group2, commonMembers, COUNT(combinedMember) AS combinedMembers

         RETURN group1.name, group2.name, toInt(round(100.0 * commonMembers / combinedMembers)) AS percentage

         ORDER BY group1.name, group1.name"

group_overlap = cypher(graph, query)

ggplot(group_overlap, aes(x=group1.name, y=group2.name, fill=percentage)) + 
  geom_bin2d() +
  geom_text(aes(label = percentage)) +
  labs(x= "Group", y="Group", title="Member Group Member Overlap") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high="red") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12, color = "black"),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, color = "black"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16, color = "black"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))

<p>A first glance at the visualisation suggests that the Hadoop, Data Science and Big Data groups have the most overlap which seems to make sense as they do cover quite similar topics.</p>


<p>Thanks to Nicole for the library and the idea of the visualisation. Now we need to do some more analysis on the data to see if there are any more interesting insights.</p>
