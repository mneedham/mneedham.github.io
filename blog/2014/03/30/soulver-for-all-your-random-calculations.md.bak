<p>I often find myself doing random calculations and I used to do so part manually and part using <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>'s calculator until <a href="https://twitter.com/apcj">Alistair</a> pointed me at <a href="http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/">Soulver</a>, a desktop/iPhone/iPad app, which is even better.</p>


<p>I thought I'd write some examples of calculations I use it for, partly so I'll remember the syntax in future!</p>


<em>Calculating how much memory Neo4j memory mapping will take up</em>

~~~text

800 mb + 2660mb + 6600mb + 9500mb + 40mb in GB = 19.6 GB
~~~

<em>How long would it take to cover 20,000 km at 100 km / day?</em>

~~~text

20,000 km / 100 km/day in months = 6.57097681677241832481 months
~~~

<em>How long did an import of some data using the Neo4j shell take?</em>

~~~text

4550855 ms in minutes = 75.84758333333333333333 minutes
~~~

<em>Bit shift 1 by 32 places</em>

~~~text

1 << 32 = 4,294,967,296
~~~

<em>Translating into easier to digest units</em>

~~~text

32381KB / second in MB per minute = 1,942.86 MB/minute
500,000 / 3 years in per hour = 19.01324310408685857874 per hour^2
~~~

<em>How long would it take to process a chunk of data?</em>

~~~text

100 GB / (32381KB / second in MB per minute)  = 51.47051254336390681778 minutes
~~~

<em>Hexadecimal to base 10</em>

~~~text

0x1111 = 4,369
1 + 16 + 16^2 + 16^3 = 4,369
~~~

<p>I'm sure there's much more that you can do that I haven't figured out yet but even for these simple examples it saves me a bunch of time.</p>
