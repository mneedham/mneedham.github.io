      <description>One of the first unusual (to me) things that I noticed from the trainers at ThoughtWorks University was that when they were listening to participants they would often ask questions and re-frame the participants&#39; comments. Intrigued and impressed by this I spoke to one of the trainers and was told that they were engaging in &#39;active listening&#39;. Wikipedia defines the term as follows:
     Active listening is an intent &#34;</description>

      <title>Giving effective feedback</title>

      <description>One of the most interesting things I have discovered since starting at ThoughtWorks earlier this month is the emphasis that is placed on giving feedback.
 The first lesson we were taught about giving feedback was that it could be one of two types. Either it should Strengthen Confidence or Increase Effectiveness.
 In Layman&amp;#8217;s term that means that if you want to make a positive comment about somebody&amp;#8217;s contribution then you should make reference to something specific that you believe they have done well so that they can continue doing it.</description>

      <title>Inheritance and Delegation</title>

      <description>One of the major learning points this week at TWU has been understanding when it is appropriate to use inheritance and when delegation is the better choice.
 I had heard stories about how inheritance could be misused but I didn&amp;#8217;t think I would be stupid enough to fall straight into that trap! We were taught the concept using &#39;Measurement&#39; as the problem domain. So to translate the previous sentence into English: The aim was to design classes which could handle old school measurement types such as Inches, Feet, Yards, and so on.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve always found it fascinating watching people who really excel in their field going about business, be it footballers, tennis players, actors, whoever.
 This week at TWU I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with some Ruby on Rails as I mentioned in the previous post, and yesterday I had the opportunity to watch one of the leading figures in the Ruby on Rails field at work. Take a bow Obie Fernandez, who gave several of the TWU attendees a demonstration of how to develop applications using Ruby on Rails.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve heard a lot about Ruby on Rails over the last couple of years but I&amp;#8217;d never really been intrigued to get it set up on my machine and &#39;have a play&#39; with it so to speak.
 It turned out to be a relatively painless process and after following the instructions on the official site I had it all setup within about half an hour which was a record for me for getting a development environment setup.</description>
