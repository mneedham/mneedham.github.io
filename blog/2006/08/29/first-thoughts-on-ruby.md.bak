I've heard a lot about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_rails" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> over the last couple of years but I'd never really been intrigued to get it set up on my machine and 'have a play' with it so to speak.

It turned out to be a relatively painless process and after following the instructions on the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">official site</a> I had it all setup within about half an hour which was a record for me for getting a development environment setup. With a bit of help from the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Ruby-Pragmatic-Programmers-Guide/dp/0974514055/sr=8-1/qid=1156856404/ref=sr_1_1/026-8829816-9098059?ie=UTF8&s=gateway" target="_blank">Pragmatic Programmers Guide to Ruby</a> I managed to get some basic pages setup. The design of the URLs and the separation of the code is actually fairly intuitive. Ruby on Rails uses the MVC (Model - View - Controller) Architecture/Design Pattern very strictly and the code for each of these is written in a separate file.

One aspect of this that made sense to me as a PHP programmer was the way that the URLs in Ruby on Rails are constructed in a "/[controller_name]/[action]" format. I also like the fact that everything in Ruby on Rails is an object, even such things as integers and strings. It takes a bit of getting used to but after using it for a bit it seems counter intuitive to do it any other way.

I don't think I'm about to become an advocate for the use of Ruby on Rails for every development project I work on - I'm still a big fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp" target="_blank">C#</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework" target="_blank">.NET</a> platform and I find it unlikely that I'll change my mind in the near future but we shall see!
