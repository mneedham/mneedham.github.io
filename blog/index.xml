      <description>Following on from the blog post where we compared how MPs and parties voted on Brexit indicative measures, in this post we&amp;#8217;re going to explore how Conservative MPs have voted with respect to a no deal exit from the European Union. In particular we&amp;#8217;d like to know whether the threat to have the party whip removed had an impact on how they voted in the recent motion to request an extension to work out a deal.</description>

      <description>In the previous post of the Graphing Brexit series we computed the average vote by party. In this post we&amp;#8217;re going to take those average party scores and compare them against the votes placed by individual MPs. The goal is to determine whether, Brexit wise, MPs are representing the right party!
 It won&amp;#8217;t be perfect since we know that not everyone in a party voted the same way, but it should still give us some fun results.</description>

      <description>Over the last week I&amp;#8217;ve revisited the Brexit Graph that I created in March 2019, this time looking at how the parties voted on average on each of the indicative votes.
 To recap, we have a graph that has the following schema:
   Since the initial post I&amp;#8217;ve slightly changed how the MEMBER_OF relationship works. As several MPs have switched MPs in the intervening months, we&amp;#8217;re now storing a start property to indicate when they started representing a party and an end property to indicate when they stopped reprsenting a party.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing with the Brexit Graph over the last few days, and wanted to map the MPs that I got from CommonsVotes with data from the TheyWorkForYou API.
 I already had voting records loaded into Neo4j, but to recap, this is how I did that:
 UNWIND [655,656,657,658,659,660,661,662,711, 669, 668, 667, 666, 664] AS division LOAD CSV FROM &#34;https://github.com/mneedham/graphing-brexit/raw/master/data/commonsvotes/Division&#34; + division + &#34;.csv&#34; AS row // Create motion nodes WITH division, collect(row) AS rows MERGE (motion:Motion {division: trim(split(rows[0][0], &#34;</description>

      <description>The Neo4j APOC library&#39;s Load CSV procedure is very useful if you want more control over the import process than the LOAD CSV clause allows. I found myself using it last week to import a CSV file of embeddings, because I wanted to know the line number of the row in the CSV file while importing the data.
 I had a file that looked like this, which I put into the import directory:</description>

      <title>Neo4j: Cypher - Nested Path Comprehensions vs OPTIONAL MATCH</title>

      <description>While writing my previous post about Cypher nested path comprehensions, I realised that for this particular problem, the OPTIONAL MATCH clause is a better choice.
 To recap, we have the following graph:
 MERGE (club:Club {name: &#34;Man Utd&#34;}) MERGE (league:League {name: &#34;Premier League&#34;}) MERGE (country:Country {name: &#34;England&#34;}) MERGE (club)-[:IN_LEAGUE]-&amp;gt;(league) MERGE (league)-[:IN_COUNTRY]-&amp;gt;(country) MERGE (club2:Club {name: &#34;Juventus&#34;}) MERGE (league2:League {name: &#34;Serie A&#34;}) MERGE (club2)-[:IN_LEAGUE]-&amp;gt;(league2)     We started the post with the following query that returns (club)-[:IN_LEAGUE]&amp;#8594;(league)-[:IN_COUNTRY]&amp;#8594;(country) paths:</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently been building an application using the GRANDstack, which uses nested Cypher path comprehensions to translate GraphQL queries to Cypher ones. I&amp;#8217;d not done this before, so I was quite curious how this feature worked. We&amp;#8217;ll explore it using the following dataset:
 MERGE (club:Club {name: &#34;Man Utd&#34;}) MERGE (league:League {name: &#34;Premier League&#34;}) MERGE (country:Country {name: &#34;England&#34;}) MERGE (club)-[:IN_LEAGUE]-&amp;gt;(league) MERGE (league)-[:IN_COUNTRY]-&amp;gt;(country) MERGE (club2:Club {name: &#34;Juventus&#34;}) MERGE (league2:League {name: &#34;Serie A&#34;</description>

      <description>Sometimes we want to be able to vary our Cypher queries based on the value of a parameter. I came across such a situation today, and thought I&amp;#8217;d share how I solved it using the APOC library.
 Let&amp;#8217;s first setup some sample data:
 UNWIND range(0, 5) AS id CREATE (:Person {name: &#34;person-&#34; + id})   Now, if we want to get all pairs of people, we could write the following query:</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been building a little CLI application using the Python Click Library, and I wanted to pass in a Date as a parameter. There&amp;#8217;s more than one way to do this.
 Let&amp;#8217;s first install the Click library:
 pip install click   And now we&amp;#8217;ll import our required libraries:
 from datetime import date import click   Now we&amp;#8217;ll create a sub command that takes two parameters: date-start and date-end.</description>

      <description>When I&amp;#8217;m learning a new technology, I often come across things that are incredibly confusing when I first come across them, but make complete sense afterwards. In this post I&amp;#8217;ll explain my experience writing a Kafka consumer that wasn&amp;#8217;t finding any messages when using consumer groups .
 Setting up Kafka infrastructure We&amp;#8217;ll set up the Kafka infrastructure locally using the Docker Compose Template that I describe in my Kafka: A Basic Tutorial blog post.</description>

      <description>In this post we&amp;#8217;re going to load tweets via the twint library into Kafka, and once we&amp;#8217;ve got them in there we&amp;#8217;ll use the Kafka Connect Neo4j Sink Plugin to get them into Neo4j.
 What is twint? Twitter data has always been some of the most fun to play with, but over the years the official API has become more and more restritive, and it now takes a really long time to download enough data to do anything interesting.</description>

      <description>If we want two Docker containers to communicate with each other they need to belong to the same network. In this post we&amp;#8217;ll learn how to find out the network of existing containers so that we can attach new containers to that network.
 All the containers mentioned in this post can be launched locally from Docker compose, using the following command:
 git clone git@github.com:mneedham/ksql-kafka-neo4j-streams.git &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd ksql-kafka-neo4j-streams docker-compose-up   Running this command will create four containers:</description>

 We&amp;#8217;ll spin up a local Kafka environment using the Docker Compose template from the Kafka Basic Tutorial blog post that I wrote last week. Let&amp;#8217;s open a terminal window and run the following commands to set up our environment:
 git clone git@github.com:mneedham/basic-kafka-tutorial.git &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd basic-kafka-tutorial docker-compose up   On another terminal window, run the following command to see the list of Docker containers that are running:</description>

      <description>In my continued playing with the KSQL streaming engine for Kafka, I came across another interesting error while trying to put a stream on top of a topic generated by the Neo4j Streams Library.
 We&amp;#8217;ll simplify the events being posted on the topic for this blog post, so this is what the events on the topic look like:
 { &#34;id&#34;:&#34;ABCDEFGHI&#34;, &#34;properties&#34;: { &#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mark&#34;, &#34;location&#34;:&#34;London&#34; } }   We then create a stream on that topic:</description>

 I was trying to create a stream over a topic dummy1, which is the simplest possible thing you can do with KSQL. The events posted to dummy1 are JSON messages containing only an id key. Below is an example of a message posted to the topic:</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been building a Docker Container that has support for Jupyter, Spark, GraphFrames, and Neo4j, and ran into a problem that had me pulling my (metaphorical) hair out!
 The pyspark-notebook container gets us most of the way there, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t have GraphFrames or Neo4j support. Adding Neo4j is as simple as pulling in the Python Driver from Conda Forge, which leaves us with GraphFrames.
 When I&amp;#8217;m using GraphFrames with pyspark locally I would pull it in via the --packages config parameter, like this:</description>

 We&amp;#8217;ll be using Neo4j via the Neo4j Desktop with the default settings. This means that we have a maximum heap size of 1GB.</description>

 It was more fiddly than I expected, so I thought I&amp;#8217;d share the code for the benefit of future me more than anything else!
 Pre requisites We&amp;#8217;re going to use the popular requests library to query the API, so we need to import that.</description>

      <description>As part of the Graphing Brexit series of blog posts, I wanted to work out who were the most important Members of the UK parliament, and after a bit of Googling I realised that views of their Wikipedia pages would do the trick.
 I initially found my way to tools.wmflabs.org, which is great for exploring the popularity of an individual MP, but not so good if you want to extract the data for 600 of them.</description>

      <description>In this post we&amp;#8217;re going to learn how to import the DBLP citation network into Neo4j using the Neo4j Import Tool.
 In case you haven&amp;#8217;t come across this dataset before, Tomaz Bratanic has a great blog post explaining it.
 The tl;dr is that we have articles, authors, and venues. Authors can write articles, articles can reference other articles, and articles are presented at a venue. Below is the graph model for this dataset:</description>

      <description>Irfan and I were playing with a dataset earlier today, and having run a bunch of graph algorithms, we had a lot of properties that we wanted to clear out.
 The following Cypher query puts Neo4j into the state that we were dealing with.

      <description>As part of a dataset I&amp;#8217;ve been working with this week, I wanted to generate a collection of a range of dates using the Cypher query language.
 I&amp;#8217;ve previously used the duration function, which lets you add (or subtract) from a specific date, so I thought I&amp;#8217;d start from there. If we want to find the day after 1st January 2019, we could write the following query:

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using Neo4j&amp;#8217;s APOC library to load some local JSON files this week, and ran into an interesting problem.
 The LOAD CSV tool assumes that any files you load locally are in the import directory, so I&amp;#8217;ve got into the habit of putting my data there. Let&amp;#8217;s check what I&amp;#8217;m trying to import by opening the import directory:

 For simplicity&amp;#8217;s sake, imagine that we have this list:

      <description>I was recently trying to automate adding a query parameter to a bunch of URLS and came across a neat approach a long way down this StackOverflow answer, that uses the PreparedRequest class from the requests library.
 Let&amp;#8217;s first get the class imported:
 from requests.models import PreparedRequest req = PreparedRequest()   And now let&amp;#8217;s use use this class to add a query parameter to a URL. We can do this with the following code:</description>

      <description>One thing that new users of Neo4j when playing around with it locally is how much space the transaction logs can take up, especially when we&amp;#8217;re creating and deleting lots of data while we get started. We can see this by running the following query a few times:
 UNWIND range(0, 1000) AS id CREATE (:Foo {id: id}); MATCH (f:Foo) DELETE f   This query creates a bunch of data before immediately deleting it.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite things about modelling data in graphs is how easy it makes it to infer relationships between pieces of data based on other relationships. In this post we&amp;#8217;re going to learn how to compute and store those inferred relationships using the triggers feature from the APOC library.
 Meetup Graph Before we get to that, let&amp;#8217;s first understand what we mean when we say inferred relationship. We&amp;#8217;ll create a small graph containing Person, Meetup, and Topic nodes with the following query:</description>

 As I pointed out in that post, sometimes the graph model doesn&amp;#8217;t fit well with what the algorithm expects, so we need to project the graph on which we run graph algorithms.</description>

 The dataset contains characters and episodes, and we want to calculate episode similarity based on the characters that appear in each episode. Before we run any algorithms we need to get the data into Neo4j.</description>

      <description>Continuing with my explorations of Strava data in Neo4j I wanted to share some things I learnt while trying to work out my pace for certain distances.
 Before we get into the pace calculations let&amp;#8217;s first understand how the duration function works. If we run the following query we might expect to get back the same value that we put in&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203;
 RETURN duration({seconds: 413.77}).seconds AS seconds   ╒═════════╕ │&#34;</description>

      <description>In my last blog post I showed how to compare instances of Neo4j&amp;#8217;s Duration data type, and in the middle of the post I realised that I needed to use the APOC library to return the value in the format I wanted. This was the solution I ended up with:
 WITH duration({seconds: 100}) AS duration RETURN apoc.text.lpad(toString(duration.minutes), 2, &#34;0&#34;) + &#34;:&#34; + apoc.text.lpad(toString(duration.secondsOfMinute), 2, &#34;0&#34;)   If we run that query this is the output:</description>

      <description>Neo4j 3.4 saw the introduction of the temporal date type, which my colleague Adam Cowley covered in his excellent blog post, and in this post I want to share my experience using durations from my Strava runs.
 I&amp;#8217;ll show how to load the whole Strava dataset in another blog post but for now we&amp;#8217;ll just manually create some durations based on the elapsed time in seconds that Strava provides. We can run the following query to convert duration in seconds into the duration type:</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks I came across a paper titled Parameter Free Hierarchical Graph-Based Clustering for Analyzing Continuous Word Embeddings via Abigail See&#39;s blog post about ACL 2017.
  The paper explains an algorithm that helps to make sense of word embeddings generated by algorithms such as Word2vec and GloVe.
 I&amp;#8217;m fascinated by how graphs can be used to interpret seemingly black box data, so I was immediately intrigued and wanted to try and reproduce their findings using Neo4j.</description>

      <description>In my previous post we looked at how to get up and running with the node2Vec algorithm, and in this post we&amp;#8217;ll learn how we can feed graph embeddings into a simple Tensorflow model.
 Recall that node2Vec takes in a list of edges (or relationships) and gives us back an embedding (array of numbers) for each node.
 This time we&amp;#8217;re going to run the algorithm over a movies recommendation dataset from the Neo4j Sandbox.</description>

      <description>In my explorations of graph based machine learning, one algorithm I came across is called node2Vec. The paper describes it as &#34;an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks&#34;.
 So what does the algorithm do? From the website:
  The node2vec framework learns low-dimensional representations for nodes in a graph by optimizing a neighborhood preserving objective. The objective is flexible, and the algorithm accommodates for various definitions of network neighborhoods by simulating biased random walks.</description>

      <description>Over the last week I&amp;#8217;ve been going over various Tensorflow tutorials and one of the best ones when getting started is Sidath Asiri&amp;#8217;s Hello World in TensorFlow, which shows how to build a simple linear classifier on the Iris dataset.
 I&amp;#8217;ll use the same data as Sidath, so if you want to follow along you&amp;#8217;ll need to download these files:

  iris_test.csv

      <description>Over the last few days I attended PyData London 2018 and wanted to share my experience. The PyData series of conferences aim to bring together users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. I presented a talk on building a recommendation with Python and Neo4j at the 2016 version but didn&amp;#8217;t attend last year.
 The organisers said there were ~ 550 attendees spread over 1 day of tutorials and 2 days of talks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with saving and loading scikit-learn models and needed to serialize and deserialize Numpy arrays as part of the process.
 I could use pickle but that seems a bit overkill so I decided instead to save the byte representation of the array. We can get that representation by calling the tobytes method on a Numpy array:
 import numpy as np &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; np.array([ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ]) array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; np.</description>

      <description>When coding in Python I often find myself with lists containing key/value pairs that I want to convert to a dictionary.
 In a recent example I had the following code:
 values = [{&#39;key&#39;: &#39;name&#39;, &#39;value&#39;: &#39;Mark&#39;}, {&#39;key&#39;: &#39;age&#39;, &#39;value&#39;: 34}]   And I wanted to create a dictionary that had the keys name and age and their respective values. The easiest way to convert this list to a dictionary is to iterate over the list and construct the dictionary key by key:</description>

 I found an article explaining how to do it on v3 of the GitHub API, but I&amp;#8217;ve got used to the v4 GraphQL API and I&amp;#8217;m not going back! Thankfully it&amp;#8217;s not too difficult to figure out.
 GitHub let you explore the API via the GitHub GraphQL Explorer and the following query gets us the information we require:</description>

   This error message happens if we try to run a query when the database hasn&amp;#8217;t been started, and would usually be accompanied by this screen:
   On this occasion that wasn&amp;#8217;t happening, but we can easily fix it by going back to the project screen and starting the database:</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing with the Leaflet.js library over the Christmas holidays to visualise running routes drawn onto the map using a Polyline and I wanted to zoom the map the right amount to see all the points. Pre requisites  We have the following HTML to define the div that will contain the map. &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;container&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;map&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;width: 100%; height: 100%&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;   We also need to import the following Javascript and CSS files: &amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;http://cdn.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been trying to find an Ethereum Hello World example and came across Thomas Conté&#39;s excellent post that shows how to compile and deploy an Ethereum smart contract with solc and web3.  In the latest version of web3 the API has changed to be based on promises so I decided to translate Thomas&#39; example. Let&#39;s get started.
Install npm libraries  We need to install these libraries before we start: npm install web3 npm install abi-decoder npm install ethereumjs-testrpc  What do these libraries do?</description>

      <description>In my last blog post I showed how to create a multi class classification ensemble using scikit-learn&#39;s VotingClassifier and finished mentioning that I didn&#39;t know which classifiers should be part of the ensemble.  We need to get a better score with each of the classifiers in the ensemble otherwise they can be excluded.  We have a TF/IDF based classifier as well as well as the classifiers I wrote about in the last post.</description>

      <description>For the Kaggle Spooky Author Identification I wanted to combine multiple classifiers together into an ensemble and found the VotingClassifier that does exactly that.  We need to predict the probability that a sentence is written by one of three authors so the VotingClassifier needs to make a &#39;soft&#39; prediction. If we only needed to know the most likely author we could have it make a &#39;hard&#39; prediction instead.  We start with three classifiers which generate different n-gram based features.</description>

      <description>In my continued exploration of Kaggle&#39;s Spooky Authors competition, I wanted to run a GridSearch turning on and off different classifiers to work out the best combination. I therefore needed to generate combinations of 1s and 0s enabling different classifiers. e.g. if we had 3 classifiers we&#39;d generate these combinations
0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1   where.</description>

      <description>I ran into an interesting Cypher error message earlier this week while trying to create an array property on a node which I thought I&#39;d share.  This was the Cypher query I wrote: CREATE (:Person {id: [1, &amp;quot;mark&amp;quot;, 2.0]})  which results in this error:
Neo.ClientError.Statement.TypeError Property values can only be of primitive types or arrays thereof.   We actually are storing an array of primitives but we have a mix of different types which isn&#39;t allowed.</description>

      <description>While reading the scikit-learn code I came across a bit of code that I didn&#39;t understand for a while but in retrospect is quite neat.  This is the code snippet that intrigued me: vocabulary = defaultdict() vocabulary.default_factory = vocabulary.__len__   Let&#39;s quickly see how it works by adapting an example from scikit-learn: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from collections import defaultdict &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vocabulary = defaultdict() &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vocabulary.default_factory = vocabulary.__len__ &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vocabulary[&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;] 0 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vocabulary.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been trying to improve my score on Kaggle&#39;s Spooky Author Identification competition, and my latest idea was building a model which used named entities extracted using the polyglot NLP library.  We&#39;ll start by learning how to extract entities form a sentence using polyglot which isn&#39;t too tricky: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from polyglot.text import Text &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; doc = &amp;quot;My name is David Beckham. Hello from London, England&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Text(doc, hint_language_code=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot;).entities [I-PER([&#39;David&#39;, &#39;Beckham&#39;]), I-LOC([&#39;London&#39;]), I-LOC([&#39;England&#39;])]   This sentence contains three entities.</description>

      <description>In this post we&#39;ll learn how to copy an existing dataset to the PersistentVolumes used by a Neo4j cluster running on Kubernetes. Neo4j Clusters on Kubernetes  This posts assumes that we&#39;re familiar with deploying Neo4j on Kubernetes. I wrote an article on the Neo4j blog explaining this in more detail.  The StatefulSet we create for our core servers require persistent storage, achieved via the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) primitive. A Neo4j cluster containing 3 core servers would have the following PVCs: $ kubectl get pvc NAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS AGE datadir-neo-helm-neo4j-core-0 Bound pvc-043efa91-cc54-11e7-bfa5-080027ab9eac 10Gi RWO standard 45s datadir-neo-helm-neo4j-core-1 Bound pvc-1737755a-cc54-11e7-bfa5-080027ab9eac 10Gi RWO standard 13s datadir-neo-helm-neo4j-core-2 Bound pvc-18696bfd-cc54-11e7-bfa5-080027ab9eac 10Gi RWO standard 11s   Each of the PVCs has a corresponding PersistentVolume (PV) that satisifies it: $ kubectl get pv NAME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES RECLAIM POLICY STATUS CLAIM STORAGECLASS REASON AGE pvc-043efa91-cc54-11e7-bfa5-080027ab9eac 10Gi RWO Delete Bound default/datadir-neo-helm-neo4j-core-0 standard 41m pvc-1737755a-cc54-11e7-bfa5-080027ab9eac 10Gi RWO Delete Bound default/datadir-neo-helm-neo4j-core-1 standard 40m pvc-18696bfd-cc54-11e7-bfa5-080027ab9eac 10Gi RWO Delete Bound default/datadir-neo-helm-neo4j-core-2 standard 40m   The PVCs and PVs are usually created at the same time that we deploy our StatefulSet.</description>

$ kubectl apply -f pod_no_while.yaml pod &amp;quot;marks-dummy-pod&amp;quot; created   And let&#39;s check if we have any running pods: $ kubectl get pods No resources found, use --show-all to see completed objects.</description>

Let&#39;s first create a graph with some duplicate nodes to play with: UNWIND range(0, 100) AS id CREATE (p1:Person {id: toInteger(rand() * id)}) MERGE (p2:Person {id: toInteger(rand() * id)}) MERGE (p3:Person {id: toInteger(rand() * id)}) MERGE (p4:Person {id: toInteger(rand() * id)}) CREATE (p1)-[:KNOWS]-&amp;gt;(p2) CREATE (p1)-[:KNOWS]-&amp;gt;(p3) CREATE (p1)-[:KNOWS]-&amp;gt;(p4) Added 173 labels, created 173 nodes, set 173 properties, created 5829 relationships, completed after 408 ms.</description>

      <description>One of the first things I do after installing Neo4j is install the APOC library, but I find it&#39;s a bit of a manual process when spinning up a server on AWS so I wanted to simplify it a bit.  There&#39;s already a Neo4j AMI which installs Neo4j 3.2.0 and my colleague Michael pointed out that we could download APOC into the correct folder by writing a script and sending it as UserData.</description>

In addition, I wanted to generate them as images on the server rather than introducing a JavaScript library.  Chris Seymour&#39;s excellent gist which shows how to create sparklines inside a Pandas dataframe got me most of the way there, but I had to tweak his code a bit to get it to play nicely with Python 3.</description>

      <description>I was doing some data cleaning a few days ago and wanting to multiply a value by 1 million. My Cypher code to do this looked like this: with &amp;quot;8.37&amp;quot; as rawNumeric RETURN toFloat(rawNumeric) * 1000000 AS numeric ╒═════════════════╕ │&amp;quot;numeric&amp;quot; │ ╞═════════════════╡ │8369999.999999999│ └─────────────────┘   Unfortunately that suffers from the classic rounding error when working with floating point numbers. I couldn&#39;t figure out a way to solve it using pure Cypher, but there tends to be an APOC function to solve every problem and this was no exception.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been using the Serverless library to deploy and run some Python functions on AWS lambda recently and was initially confused about how to handle my dependencies.  I tend to create a new virtualenv for each of my project so let&#39;s get that setup first: Prerequisites $ npm install serverless  $ virtualenv -p python3 a $ . a/bin/activate   Now let&#39;s create our Serverless project. I&#39;m going to install the requests library so that I can use it in my function.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been writing a bit of code to integrate with a ClassMarker webhook, and you&#39;re required to check that an incoming request actually came from ClassMarker by checking the value of a base64 hash using HMAC SHA256.  The example in the documentation is written in PHP which I haven&#39;t done for about 10 years so I had to figure out how to do the same thing in Python.  This is the PHP version: $ php -a php &amp;gt; echo base64_encode(hash_hmac(&amp;quot;sha256&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;my data&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;my_secret&amp;quot;, true)); vyniKpNSlxu4AfTgSJImt+j+pRx7v6m+YBobfKsoGhE=   The Python equivalent is a bit more code but it&#39;s not too bad.</description>

      <description>I sometimes needs to create custom Neo4j Docker images to try things out and wanted to share my work flow, mostly for future Mark but also in case it&amp;rsquo;s useful to someone else.
There&amp;rsquo;s already a docker-neo4j repository so we&amp;rsquo;ll just tweak the files in there to achieve what we want.
$ git clone git@github.com:neo4j/docker-neo4j.git $ cd docker-neo4j  If we want to build a Docker image for Neo4j Enterprise Edition we can run the following build target:</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with Kaggle in my spare time over the last few weeks and came across an unexpected behaviour when trying to add a column to a dataframe.  First let&#39;s get Panda&#39;s into our program scope: Prerequisites import pandas as pd   Now we&#39;ll create a data frame to play with for the duration of this post: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; df = pd.DataFrame({&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;: [1,2,3,4,5], &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;: [2,3,4,5,6]}) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; df a b 0 5 2 1 6 6 2 0 8 3 3 2 4 1 6   Let&#39;s say we want to create a new column which returns True if either of the numbers are odd.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been using panda&#39;s get_dummies function to generate dummy columns for categorical variables to use with scikit-learn, but noticed that it sometimes doesn&#39;t work as I expect.
Prerequisites import pandas as pd import numpy as np from sklearn import linear_model  Let&#39;s say we have the following training and test sets:

      <description>In my continued playing around with the Kaggle house prices dataset I wanted to find any columns/fields that have null values in.  If we want to get a count of the number of null fields by column we can use the following code, adapted from Poonam Ligade&#39;s kernel: Prerequisites import pandas as pd  Count the null columns train = pd.read_csv(&amp;quot;train.csv&amp;quot;) null_columns=train.columns[train.isnull().any()] train[null_columns].isnull().sum()  LotFrontage 259 Alley 1369 MasVnrType 8 MasVnrArea 8 BsmtQual 37 BsmtCond 37 BsmtExposure 38 BsmtFinType1 37 BsmtFinType2 38 Electrical 1 FireplaceQu 690 GarageType 81 GarageYrBlt 81 GarageFinish 81 GarageQual 81 GarageCond 81 PoolQC 1453 Fence 1179 MiscFeature 1406 dtype: int64   So there are lots of different columns containing null values.</description>

      <description>I recently needed to generate a string with comma separated values, based on iterating a range of numbers.  e.g. we should get the following output where n = 3 foo-0,foo-1,foo-2  I only had the shell available to me so I couldn&#39;t shell out into Python or Ruby for example. That means it&#39;s bash scripting time!
 If we want to iterate a range of numbers and print them out on the screen we can write the following code: n=3 for i in $(seq 0 $(($n &amp;gt; 0?</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a blog post a couple of weeks ago, I&#39;ve been playing around with the Kaggle House Prices competition and the most recent thing I tried was training a random forest regressor.  Unfortunately, although it gave me better results locally it got a worse score on the unseen data, which I figured meant I&#39;d overfitted the model.  I wasn&#39;t really sure how to work out if that theory was true or not, but by chance I was reading Chris Albon&#39;s blog and found a post where he explains how to inspect the importance of every feature in a random forest.</description>

      <description>When running Kubernetes on a cloud provider, rather than locally using minikube, it&#39;s useful to know which node a pod is running on.  The normal command to list pods doesn&#39;t contain this information: $ kubectl get pod NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE neo4j-core-0 1/1 Running 0 6m neo4j-core-1 1/1 Running 0 6m neo4j-core-2 1/1 Running 0 2m   I spent a while searching for a command that I could use before I came across Ta-Ching Chen&#39;s blog post while looking for something else.</description>

Poonam wrote the following code to identify which columns in the dataset had the most missing values: import pandas as pd train = pd.read_csv(&#39;train.csv&#39;) null_columns=train.columns[train.isnull().any()] &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(train[null_columns].isnull().sum()) LotFrontage 259 Alley 1369 MasVnrType 8 MasVnrArea 8 BsmtQual 37 BsmtCond 37 BsmtExposure 38 BsmtFinType1 37 BsmtFinType2 38 Electrical 1 FireplaceQu 690 GarageType 81 GarageYrBlt 81 GarageFinish 81 GarageQual 81 GarageCond 81 PoolQC 1453 Fence 1179 MiscFeature 1406 dtype: int64   The one that I&#39;m most interested in is LotFrontage, which describes &#39;Linear feet of street connected to property&#39;.</description>

Neo4j sponsored the conference as we&#39;ve been experimenting with building a GraphQL to Neo4j integration and wanted to get some feedback from the community as well as learn what&#39;s going on in GraphQL land.
Will and Michael have written about their experience where they talk more about the hackathon we hosted so I&#39;ll cover it more from a personal perspective.</description>

      <description>In my last post I showed how to load and query data from the Strava API in PostgreSQL and after executing some simple queries my next task was to query more complex part of the JSON structure.   Strava allows users to create segments, which are edited portions of road or trail where athletes can compete for time.  I wanted to write a query to find all the times that I&#39;d run a particular segment.</description>

      <description>In my last post I showed how to map Strava runs using data that I&#39;d extracted from their /activities API, but the API returns a lot of other data that I discarded because I wasn&#39;t sure what I should keep.  The API returns a nested JSON structure so the easiest solution would be to save each run as an individual file but I&#39;ve always wanted to try out PostgreSQL&#39;s JSON data type and this seemed like a good opportunity.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m a big Strava user and spent a bit of time last weekend playing around with their API to work out how to map all my runs.  Strava API and polylines  This is a two step process:   Call the /athlete/activities/ endpoint to get a list of all my activities For each of those activities call /activities/[activityId] endpoint to get more detailed information for each activity   That second API returns a &#39;polyline&#39; property which the documentation describes as follows:  Activity and segment API requests may include summary polylines of their respective routes.</description>

 It&#39;s actually not too tricky. If we&#39;re in the scope of the app context then we have access to the template rendering that we&#39;d normally use when serving the response to a web request.</description>

To achieve that in AWS Lambda land we need to create a CloudWatch Event. The documentation describes them as follows:  Using simple rules that you can quickly set up, you can match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams.</description>

The following function takes in both an encrypted and unencrypted variable and prints them out.
 Don&#39;t print out encrypted variables in a real function, this is just so we can see the example working! import boto3 import os from base64 import b64decode def lambda_handler(event, context): encrypted = os.</description>

As well as creating that CSV file I wanted to go back to the meetup.com API and download all the members of those groups.
This was a rough flow of what i wanted to do:
  Take JSON document containing all groups   Parse that document and for each group:    Call the /members endpoint   Save each one of those files as a JSON file    Iterate over all those JSON files and create a members CSV file   In the previous post we created the GroupsToJSON task which calls the /groups endpoint on the meetup API and creates the file /tmp/groups.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with the Python library Luigi which is used to build pipelines of batch jobs and I struggled to find an example of an ExternalProgramTask so this is my attempt at filling that void.   I&#39;m building a little data pipeline to get data from the meetup.com API and put it into CSV files that can be loaded into Neo4j using the LOAD CSV command.  The first task I created calls the /groups endpoint and saves the result into a JSON file: import luigi import requests import json from collections import Counter class GroupsToJSON(luigi.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve recently upgraded to Python 3 (I know, took me a while!) and realised that one of my scripts that writes JSON to a file no longer works!  This is a simplified version of what I&#39;m doing: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import json &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = {&amp;quot;mark&amp;quot;: {&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Mark&amp;quot;}, &amp;quot;michael&amp;quot;: {&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Michael&amp;quot;} } &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; json.dumps(x.values()) Traceback (most recent call last): File &amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; File &amp;quot;/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.0/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/json/__init__.py&amp;quot;, line 231, in dumps return _default_encoder.</description>

      <description>I often find myself wanting to convert date strings into Unix timestamps using Neo4j&#39;s APOC library and unfortunately some sources don&#39;t use the format that apoc.date.parse expects. e.g.
return apoc.date.parse(&amp;quot;2012-11-12T08:46:15Z&amp;quot;,&#39;s&#39;) AS ts Failed to invoke function `apoc.date.parse`: Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: java.text.ParseException: Unparseable date: &amp;quot;2012-11-12T08:46:15Z&amp;quot;  We need to define the format explicitly so the SimpleDataFormat documentation comes in handy. I tried the following: return apoc.date.parse(&amp;quot;2012-11-12T08:46:15Z&amp;quot;,&#39;s&#39;,&amp;quot;yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ&amp;quot;) AS ts Failed to invoke function `apoc.</description>

      <description>Every now and then I find myself wanting to import a CSV file into Neo4j and I always get confused with how to handle the various null values that can lurk within.  Let&#39;s start with an example that doesn&#39;t have a CSV file in sight. Consider the following list and my attempt to only return null values: WITH [null, &amp;quot;null&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Mark&amp;quot;] AS values UNWIND values AS value WITH value WHERE value = null RETURN value (no changes, no records)   Hmm that&#39;s weird.</description>

They&amp;rsquo;re all written in Python but I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be a fun exercise to see what they&amp;rsquo;d look like in Go. My eventual goal is to try and parallelise the API calls.

      <description>For a bit of Christmas holiday fun I thought it&#39;d be cool to create a graph of the different blips on the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar and how the recommendations have changed over time. I wrote a script to extract each blip (e.g. .NET Core) and the recommendation made in each radar that it appeared in. I ended up with a CSV file:
|----------------------------------------------+----------+-------------| | technology | date | suggestion | |----------------------------------------------+----------+-------------| | AppHarbor | Mar 2012 | Trial | | Accumulate-only data | Nov 2015 | Assess | | Accumulate-only data | May 2015 | Assess | | Accumulate-only data | Jan 2015 | Assess | | Buying solutions you can only afford one of | Mar 2012 | Hold | |----------------------------------------------+----------+-------------|   I then wrote a Cypher script to create the following graph model:   WITH [&amp;quot;Hold&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Assess&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Trial&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Adopt&amp;quot;] AS positions UNWIND RANGE (0, size(positions) - 2) AS index WITH positions[index] AS pos1, positions[index + 1] AS pos2 MERGE (position1:Position {value: pos1}) MERGE (position2:Position {value: pos2}) MERGE (position1)-[:NEXT]-&amp;gt;(position2); load csv with headers from &amp;quot;file:///blips.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I&#39;ve been playing around with docker and learning how to spin up a Neo4j Causal Cluster.
Causal Clustering is Neo4j&#39;s new clustering architecture which makes use of Diego Ongaro&#39;s Raft consensus algorithm to ensure writes are committed on a majority of servers. It&#39;ll be available in the 3.1 series of Neo4j which is currently in beta. I&#39;ll be using BETA3 in this post.   I don&#39;t know much about docker but luckily my colleague Kevin Van Gundy wrote a blog post a couple of weeks ago explaining how to spin up Neo4j inside a docker container which was very helpful for getting me started.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I wrote a blog post showing how to find the midpoint between two lat/longs using Cypher which worked well as a first attempt at filling in missing locations, but I realised I could do better.  As I mentioned in the last post, when I find a stop that&#39;s missing lat/long coordinates I can usually find two nearby stops that allow me to triangulate this stop&#39;s location.
I also have train routes which indicate the number of seconds it takes to go from one stop to another, which allows me to indicate whether the location-less stop is closer to one stop than the other.</description>

      <description>Over the last couple of weekends I&#39;ve been playing around with some transport data and I wanted to run the A* algorithm to find the quickest route between two stations.
The A* algorithm takes an estimateEvaluator as one of its parameters and the evaluator looks at lat/longs of nodes to work out whether a path is worth following or not. I therefore needed to add lat/longs for each station and I found it surprisingly hard to find this location date for all the points in the dataset.</description>

      <description>One of the things I&#39;ve often found frustrating when importing data using Cypher, Neo4j&#39;s query language, is that it&#39;s quite difficult to create dynamic relationship types. Say we have a CSV file structured like this:
load csv with headers from &amp;quot;file:///people.csv&amp;quot; AS row RETURN row  ╒═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╕ │row │ ╞═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╡ │{node1: Mark, node2: Reshmee, relationship: MARRIED_TO}│ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │{node1: Mark, node2: Alistair, relationship: FRIENDS} │ └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  We want to create nodes with the relationship type specified in the file.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with a dataset which has the timetable for the national rail in the UK and they give you departure and arrival times of each train in a textual format. For example, the node to represent a stop could be created like this:
CREATE (stop:Stop {arrival: &amp;quot;0802&amp;quot;, departure: &amp;quot;0803H&amp;quot;})   That time format isn&#39;t particular amenable to querying so I wanted to add another property which indicated the number of seconds since the start of the day.</description>

      <description>Last week I was helping someone load the data from a CSV file into Neo4j and we were having trouble filtering out rows which contained a null value in one of the columns.  This is what the data looked like: load csv with headers from &amp;quot;file:///foo.csv&amp;quot; as row RETURN row  ╒══════════════════════════════════╕ │row │ ╞══════════════════════════════════╡ │{key1: a, key2: (null), key3: c}│ ├──────────────────────────────────┤ │{key1: d, key2: e, key3: f} │ └──────────────────────────────────┘   We&#39;d like to filter out any rows which have &#39;key2&#39; as null, so let&#39;s tweak our query to do that: load csv with headers from &amp;quot;file:///foo.</description>

      <description>A couple of days I was trying to write a Cypher query to filter the labels in my database. I started with the following procedure call to get the list of all the labels:
CALL db.labels  ╒══════════╕ │label │ ╞══════════╡ │Airport │ ├──────────┤ │Flight │ ├──────────┤ │Airline │ ├──────────┤ │Movie │ ├──────────┤ │AirportDay│ ├──────────┤ │Person │ ├──────────┤ │Engineer │ └──────────┘  I was only interested in labels that contained the letter &#39;a&#39; so I tweaked the query to filter the output of the procedure: CALL db.</description>

The metric used to evaluate the output in this competition is multi class logarithmic loss, which is implemented by the log_loss function in the scikit-learn library.</description>

      <description>In my last post I attempted to cluster Game of Thrones episodes based on character appearances without much success. After I wrote that post I was flicking through the scikit-learn clustering documentation and noticed the following section which describes some of the weaknesses of the K-means clustering algorithm:  Inertia is not a normalized metric: we just know that lower values are better and zero is optimal. But in very high-dimensional spaces, Euclidean distances tend to become inflated (this is an instance of the so-called “curse of dimensionality”).</description>

      <description>In my last post I showed how to find similar Game of Thrones episodes based on the characters that appear in different episodes. This allowed us to find similar episodes on an episode by episode basis, but I was curious whether there were groups of similar episodes that we could identify. scikit-learn provides several clustering algorithms that can run over our episode vectors and hopefully find clusters of similar episodes.</description>

The dataset is available as CSV files but for this analysis I&#39;m assuming that it&#39;s already been imported into neo4j. If you want to import the data you can run the tutorial by typing the following into the query bar of the neo4j browser: :play http://guides.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago I downloaded the meta data for a few thousand computer science papers so that I could try and write a mini recommendation engine to tell me what paper I should read next.  Since I don&#39;t have any data on which people read each paper a collaborative filtering approach is ruled out, so instead I thought I could try content based filtering instead.  Let&#39;s quickly check the Wikipedia definition of content based filtering:  In a content-based recommender system, keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes.</description>

I got the example compiling by using the following Maven dependency: &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.apache.mahout&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;mahout-core&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;0.9&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;  Unfortunately when I ran the code I ran into a version incompatibility problem:

 Unfortunately all my attempts to upload any files from my local file system to HDFS were being met with the following exception: java.io.IOException: File /user/markneedham/book2.txt could only be replicated to 0 nodes, instead of 1 at org.</description>

      <description>Last week we hosted a Game of Thrones based intro to Cypher at the Women Who Code London meetup and in preparation had to scrape the wiki to build a dataset.  I&#39;ve built lots of datasets this way and it&#39;s a painless experience as long as the pages make liberal use of CSS classes and/or IDs.  Unfortunately the Game of Thrones wiki doesn&#39;t really do that so I had to find another way to extract the data I wanted - extracting elements based on their position to more prominent elements on the page.</description>

# text I don&#39;t care about = Heading of the bit I care about # text I care about  In other words I want to find the line that contains the Heading and then get all the text after that point.</description>

Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister Daniel Naprous as Oznak zo Pahl(credited as Stunt Performer) Filip Lozić as Young Nobleman Morgan C. Jones as a Braavosi captain Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Malko  So the pattern is:</description>

      <description>The day before Graph Connect Europe 2016 we needed to create a bunch of USB sticks containing Neo4j and the training materials and eventually iterated our way to a half decent approach which made use of the GNU parallel command which I&#39;ve always wanted to use!  But first I needed to get a USB hub so I could do lots of them at the same time. I bought the EasyAcc USB 3.</description>

      <description>In my previous blog post I showed how to add a new property/field to a node with a label/record in a table for a football transfers dataset that I&#39;ve been playing with. After introducing this &#39;nationality&#39; property I realised that I now had some duplication in the model:

   players.nationality and clubs.country are referring to the same countries but they&#39;ve both got them stored as strings so we can&#39;t ensure the integrity of our countries and ensure that we&#39;re referring to the same country.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago I presented a webinar comparing how you&#39;d model and evolve a data model using a Postgres SQL database and Neo4j.
This is what the two data models looked like after the initial data import and before any refactoring/migration had been done:

I wanted to add a &#39;nationality&#39; property to the players table in the SQL schema and to the nodes with the &#39;Player&#39; label in the graph.</description>

      <description>I recently found myself writing an R script to extract parts of a string based on a beginning and end index which is reasonably easy using the substr function: &amp;gt; substr(&amp;quot;mark loves graphs&amp;quot;, 0, 4) [1] &amp;quot;mark&amp;quot;   But what if we have a vector of start and end positions? &amp;gt; substr(&amp;quot;mark loves graphs&amp;quot;, c(0, 6), c(4, 10)) [1] &amp;quot;mark&amp;quot;  Hmmm that didn&#39;t work as I expected! It turns out we actually need to use the substring function instead which wasn&#39;t initially obvious to me on reading the documentation:</description>

For example let&#39;s say we&#39;re writing a bit of code to calculate the frequency of terms across some documents. We might write the following code:
library(tm) text = c(&amp;quot;I am Mark I am Mark&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Neo4j is cool Neo4j is cool&amp;quot;) corpus = VCorpus(VectorSource(text)) tdm = as.</description>

      <description>In the middle of last year I blogged about the Smart Local Moving algorithm which is used for community detection in networks and with the upcoming introduction of procedures in Neo4j I thought it&#39;d be fun to make that code accessible as one.  If you want to grab the code and follow along it&#39;s sitting on the SLM repository on my github. At the moment the procedure is hard coded to work with a KNOWS relationship between two nodes but that could easily be changed.</description>

We&#39;re going to be using the RNeo4j library to interact with the database along with a few other libraries which will help us out with different tasks:</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve previously found it very difficult to read math heavy content which has made it challenging to read Distributed Computing which I bought last May.  After several false starts where I gave up after getting frustrated that I couldn&#39;t understand things the first time around and forgot everything if I left it a couple of days I decided to try again with a different approach. I&#39;ve been trying a technique I learned from Mini Habits where every day I have a (very small) goal of reading one page of the book.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been following Michy Alice&#39;s logistic regression tutorial to create an attendance model for London dev meetups and ran into an interesting problem while doing so.  Our dataset has a class imbalance i.e. most people RSVP &#39;no&#39; to events which can lead to misleading accuracy score where predicting &#39;no&#39; every time would lead to supposed high accuracy. Source: local data frame [2 x 2] attended n (dbl) (int) 1 0 1541 2 1 53  I sampled the data using caret&#39;s upSample function to avoid this: attended = as.</description>

I couldn&#39;t work out how to solve the problem immediately so I simplified the problem into pairs of letters i.e. A	B	(A is the same as B) B	C	(B is the same as C) C	D	... E	F	(E is the same as F) F	G	.</description>

      <description>For optimal traversal speed in Neo4j queries we should make our relationship types as specific as possible.  Let&#39;s take a look at an example from the &#39;modelling a recommendations engine&#39; talk I presented at Skillsmatter a couple of weeks ago.  I needed to decided how to model the &#39;RSVP&#39; relationship between a Member and an Event. A person can RSVP &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39; to an event and I&#39;d like to capture both of these responses.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday I spoke at the Neo4j London user group about incrementally building a recommendation engine and described the &#39;facts as nodes&#39; modeling pattern, defined as follows in the Graph Databases book:  When two or more domain entities interact for a period of time, a fact emerges. We represent a fact as a separate node with connections to each of the entities engaged in that fact. Modeling an action in terms of its product—that is, in terms of the thing that results from the action—produces a similar structure: an intermediate node that represents the outcome of an interaction between two or more entities.</description>

I use Python for most of my hacking these days and if HTTP requests are required the requests library is my first port of call. I started out with the following script import requests import json def stream_meetup_initial(): uri = &amp;quot;http://stream.meetup.com/2/rsvps&amp;quot; response = requests.</description>

I created a container with the following command: docker run --detach --publish=7474:7474 neo4j/neo4j   And then tried to access the Neo4j server locally: $ curl http://localhost:7474 curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 7474: Connection refused  I quickly checked that docker had started up Neo4j correctly:</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been using Spark again lately to do some pre-processing on the Land Registry data set and ran into an initially confusing problem when trying to parse the CSV file.  I&#39;m using the Databricks CSV parsing library and wrote the following script to go over each row, collect up the address components and then derive a &#39;fullAddress&#39; field.  To refresh, this is what the CSV file looks like: $ head -n5 pp-complete.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve previously written a couple of blog posts describing the mechanics of analysing the Land Registry data set and I thought it was about time I described some of the queries I&#39;ve been running the discoveries I&#39;ve made. To recap, the land registry provides a 3GB, 20 million line CSV file containing all the property sales in the UK since 1995. We&#39;ll be loading and query the data in R using the data.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with the jq library again over the past couple of days to convert the JSON from the Stack Overflow API into CSV and found myself needing to deal with an optional field.  I&#39;ve downloaded 100 or so questions and stored them as an array in a JSON array like so: $ head -n 100 so.json [ { &amp;quot;has_more&amp;quot;: true, &amp;quot;items&amp;quot;: [ { &amp;quot;is_answered&amp;quot;: false, &amp;quot;delete_vote_count&amp;quot;: 0, &amp;quot;body_markdown&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been following Scott Barnham&#39;s guide to transforming UK postcodes into (lat, long) coordinates and needed to install the PROJ.4 Cartographic Projections library which I initially struggled with.  The first step is to download a tar.gz version which is linked from the wiki page: $ wget http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-4.9.1.tar.gz   Next we&#39;ll unpack the file and then build the binaries: $ tar -xvf proj-4.9.1.tar.gz $ cd proj-4.9.1 $ ./configure --prefix ~/projects/land-registry/proj-4.</description>

      <description>As part of my exploration of the Land Registry price paid data set I wanted to compare the difference between consecutive sales of properties.  This means we need to group the sales by a property identifier and then get the previous sale price into a column on each row unless it&#39;s the first sale in which case we&#39;ll have &#39;NA&#39;. We can do this by creating a lag variable.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a couple of blog posts already, I&#39;ve been exploring the Land Registry price paid data set and although I&#39;ve initially been using SparkR I was curious how easy it would be to explore the data set using plain R.  I thought I&#39;d start out by loading the data into a data frame and run the same queries using deployer.  I&#39;ve come across Hadley Wickham&#39;s readr library before but hadn&#39;t used it and since I needed to load a 20 million line CSV file this seemed the perfect time to give it a try.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been wanting to play around with SparkR for a while and over the weekend deciding to explore a large Land Registry CSV file containing all the sales of properties in the UK over the last 20 years. First I started up the SparkR shell with the CSV package loaded in:
./spark-1.5.0-bin-hadoop2.6/bin/sparkR --packages com.databricks:spark-csv_2.11:1.2.0   Next I tried to read the CSV file into a Spark data frame by modifying one of the examples from the tutorial: &amp;gt; sales &amp;lt;- read.</description>

When tweaking the queries it&#39;s easy to make a mistake and end up not creating the same data so I decided to write a script which will show me the aggregates of all the commands executed.  I want to see the number of constraints created, indexes added, nodes, relationships and properties created.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with the Road Safety open data set and the download comes with several CSV files and an excel spreadsheet containing the legend.  There are 45 sheets in total and each of them looks like this:   I wanted to create a CSV file for each sheet so that I can import the data set into Neo4j using the LOAD CSV command. I came across the Python Excel website which pointed me at the xlrd library since I&#39;m working with a pre 2010 Excel file.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve previously written a couple of blog posts showing how to strip out the byte order mark (BOM) from CSV files to make loading them into Neo4j easier and today I came across another way to clean up the file using tail.  The BOM is 3 bytes long at the beginning of the file so if we know that a file contains it then we can strip out those first 3 bytes tail like this: $ time tail -c +4 Casualty7904.</description>

      <description>Back in 2013 I wrote a couple of blog posts showing examples of an unmanaged extension which had a streamed and gzipped response but two years on I realised they were a bit out of date and deserved a refresh.  When writing unmanaged extensions in Neo4j a good rule of thumb is to try and reduce the amount of objects you keep hanging around. In this context this means that we should stream our response to the client as quickly as possible rather than building it up in memory and sending it in one go.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve become quite interesting in record linkage recently and came across the Duke project which provides some tools to help solve this problem. I thought I&#39;d give it a try.
 The typical problem when doing record linkage is that we have two records from different data sets which represent the same entity but don&#39;t have a common key that we can use to merge them together. We therefore need to come up with a heuristic that will allow us to do so.</description>

I thought it&#39;d be a fun exercise to translate my code to use it.  So to recap our goal: we want to count how many times each type of crime has been committed.</description>

      <description>When writing Cypher queries I sometimes find myself wanting to remove consecutive duplicates in collections that I&#39;ve joined together. e.g we might start with the following query where 1 and 7 appear consecutively:
RETURN [1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,8] AS values ==&amp;gt; +-----------------------+ ==&amp;gt; | values | ==&amp;gt; +-----------------------+ ==&amp;gt; | [1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,8] | ==&amp;gt; +-----------------------+ ==&amp;gt; 1 row   We want to end up with [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. We can start by exploding our array and putting consecutive elements next to each other: WITH [1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,8] AS values UNWIND RANGE(0, LENGTH(values) - 2) AS idx RETURN idx, idx+1, values[idx], values[idx+1] ==&amp;gt; +-------------------------------------------+ ==&amp;gt; | idx | idx+1 | values[idx] | values[idx+1] | ==&amp;gt; +-------------------------------------------+ ==&amp;gt; | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | ==&amp;gt; | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | ==&amp;gt; | 2 | 3 | 2 | 3 | ==&amp;gt; | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | ==&amp;gt; | 4 | 5 | 4 | 5 | ==&amp;gt; | 5 | 6 | 5 | 6 | ==&amp;gt; | 6 | 7 | 6 | 7 | ==&amp;gt; | 7 | 8 | 7 | 7 | ==&amp;gt; | 8 | 9 | 7 | 8 | ==&amp;gt; +-------------------------------------------+ ==&amp;gt; 9 rows  Next we can filter out rows which have the same values since that means they have consecutive duplicates:</description>

      <description>In my continued playing with the Chicago crime data set I wanted to connect the crimes committed to their position in the FBI crime type hierarchy.  These are the sub graphs that I want to connect:   We have a &#39;fbiCode&#39; on each &#39;Crime&#39; node which indicates which &#39;Crime Sub Category&#39; the crime belongs to.
I started with the following query to connect the nodes together:
MATCH (crime:Crime) WITH crime SKIP {skip} LIMIT 10000 MATCH (subCat:SubCategory {code: crime.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been doing a bit of adhoc measurement of some cypher queries executed via py2neo and wanted to work out how many milliseconds each query was taking end to end.   I thought there&#39;d be an obvious way of doing this but if there is it&#39;s evaded me so far and I ended up calculating the different between two datetime objects which gave me the following timedelta object: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import datetime &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; start = datetime.</description>

      <title>Neo4j: From JSON to CSV to LOAD CSV via jq</title>

      <description>In my last blog post I showed how to import a Chicago crime categories &amp;amp; sub categories JSON document using Neo4j&amp;rsquo;s cypher query language via the py2neo driver. While this is a good approach for people with a developer background, many of the users I encounter aren&amp;rsquo;t developers and favour using Cypher via the Neo4j browser. If we&#39;re going to do this we&#39;ll need to transform our JSON document into a CSV file so that we can use the LOAD CSV command on it.</description>

      <title>Neo4j: Loading JSON documents with Cypher</title>

      <description>One of the most commonly asked questions I get asked is how to load JSON documents into Neo4j and although Cypher doesn&#39;t have a &#39;LOAD JSON&#39; command we can still get JSON data into the graph.  Michael shows how to do this from various languages in this blog post and I recently wanted to load a JSON document that I generated from Chicago crime types.  This is a snippet of the JSON document: { &amp;quot;categories&amp;quot;: [ { &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Index Crime&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sub_categories&amp;quot;: [ { &amp;quot;code&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;01A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Homicide 1st &amp;amp; 2nd Degree&amp;quot; } ] }, { &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Non-Index Crime&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sub_categories&amp;quot;: [ { &amp;quot;code&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;01B&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Involuntary Manslaughter&amp;quot; } ] }, { &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Violent Crime&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sub_categories&amp;quot;: [ { &amp;quot;code&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;01A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Homicide 1st &amp;amp; 2nd Degree&amp;quot; } ] } ] }   We want to create the following graph structure from this document:    We can then connect the crimes to the appropriate sub category and write aggregation queries that drill down from the category.</description>

      <description>I recently came across an interesting post on Julia Evans&#39; blog showing how to generate a bigger set of data points by sampling the small set of data points that we actually have using bootstrapping. Julia&#39;s examples are all in Python so I thought it&#39;d be a fun exercise to translate them into R.  We&#39;re doing the bootstrapping to simulate the number of no-shows for a flight so we can work out how many seats we can overbook the plane by.</description>

      <description>I came across Twitter&#39;s anomaly detection library last year but haven&#39;t yet had a reason to take it for a test run so having got my blog post frequency data into shape I thought it&#39;d be fun to run it through the algorithm. I wanted to see if it would detect any periods of time when the number of posts differed significantly - I don&#39;t really have an action I&#39;m going to take based on the results, it&#39;s curiosity more than anything else!</description>

      <description>Given we&#39;re still in pre season transfer madness as far as European football is concerned I thought it&#39;d be interesting to put together a football transfers graph to see whether there are any interesting insights to be had.  It took me a while to find an appropriate source but I eventually came across transfermarkt.co.uk which contains transfers going back at least as far as the start of the Premier League in 1992.</description>

      <description>I was recently doing some text scrubbing and had difficulty working out how to remove the &#39;†&#39; character from strings. e.g. I had a string like this:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; u&#39;foo †&#39; u&#39;foo \u2020&#39;  I wanted to get rid of the &#39;†&#39; character and then strip any trailing spaces so I&#39;d end up with the string &#39;foo&#39;. I tried to do this in one call to &#39;replace&#39;:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; u&#39;foo †&#39;.replace(&amp;quot; †&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;) Traceback (most recent call last): File &amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; UnicodeDecodeError: &#39;ascii&#39; codec can&#39;t decode byte 0xe2 in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)   It took me a while to work out that &#34;</description>

Taking the last 10 years worth of data there have always had 32 seeds and with the following function we can feed in a seeding and get back the round they would be expected to reach: expected_round = function(seeding) { if(seeding == 1) { return(&amp;quot;Winner&amp;quot;) } else if(seeding == 2) { return(&amp;quot;Finals&amp;quot;) } else if(seeding &amp;lt;= 4) { return(&amp;quot;Semi-Finals&amp;quot;) } else if(seeding &amp;lt;= 8) { return(&amp;quot;Quarter-Finals&amp;quot;) } else if(seeding &amp;lt;= 16) { return(&amp;quot;Round of 16&amp;quot;) } else { return(&amp;quot;Round of 32&amp;quot;) } } &amp;gt; expected_round(1) [1] &amp;quot;Winner&amp;quot; &amp;gt; expected_round(4) [1] &amp;quot;Semi-Finals&amp;quot;   We can then have a look at each of the Wimbledon tournaments and work out how far they actually got.</description>

      <description>In my continued exploration of Wimbledon data I wanted to work out whether a player had done as well as their seeding suggested they should. I therefore wanted to work out the difference between the round they reached and the round they were expected to reach. A &#39;round&#39; in the dataset is an ordered factor variable.  These are all the possible values: rounds = c(&amp;quot;Did not enter&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Round of 128&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Round of 64&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Round of 32&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Round of 16&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Quarter-Finals&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Semi-Finals&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Finals&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Winner&amp;quot;)  And if we want to factorise a couple of strings into this factor we would do it like this:</description>

      <description>Over the past few days I&#39;ve written a few blog posts about a Wimbledon data set I&#39;ve been building and after running the scripts a few times I noticed that it was taking much longer to run that I expected.  To recap, I started out with the following function which takes in a URI and returns a data frame containing a row for each match: library(rvest) library(dplyr) scrape_matches1 = function(uri) { matches = data.</description>

      <description>Recently I had a data frame which contained a column which had mostly empty values: &amp;gt; data.frame(col1 = c(1,2,3,4,5), col2 = c(&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, NA, NA , &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;, NA)) col1 col2 1 1 a 2 2 &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; 3 3 &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; 4 4 b 5 5 &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;   I wanted to fill in the NA values with the last non NA value from that column. So I want the data frame to look like this: 1 1 a 2 2 a 3 3 a 4 4 b 5 5 b   I spent ages searching around before I came across the na.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been reading Text Processing with Ruby over the last week or so and one of the ideas the author describes is setting up your scripts so you can run them directly from the command line.
 I wanted to do this with my Wimbledon R script and wrote the following script which uses the &#39;Rscript&#39; executable so that R doesn&#39;t launch in interactive mode: wimbledon
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript library(rvest) library(dplyr) library(stringr) library(readr) # stuff   Then I tried to run it: $ time .</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of the day working on my Wimbledon data set and the next thing I explored is all the people that have beaten Andy Murray in the tournament. The following dplyr query gives us the names of those people and the year the match took place:
library(dplyr) &amp;gt; main_matches %&amp;gt;% filter(loser == &amp;quot;Andy Murray&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% select(winner, year) winner year 1 Grigor Dimitrov 2014 2 Roger Federer 2012 3 Rafael Nadal 2011 4 Rafael Nadal 2010 5 Andy Roddick 2009 6 Rafael Nadal 2008 7 Marcos Baghdatis 2006 8 David Nalbandian 2005  As you can see, Rafael Nadal shows up multiple times.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a previous blog post, I&#39;ve been scraping data for the Wimbledon tennis tournament, and having got the data for the last ten years I wrote a query using dplyr to find out how players did each year over that period.  I ended up with the following functions to filter my data frame of all the matches: round_reached = function(player, main_matches) { furthest_match = main_matches %&amp;gt;% filter(winner == player | loser == player) %&amp;gt;% arrange(desc(round)) %&amp;gt;% head(1) return(ifelse(furthest_match$winner == player, &amp;quot;Winner&amp;quot;, as.</description>

      <description>Given Wimbledon starts next week I wanted to find a data set to explore before it gets underway. Having searched around and failed to find one I had to resort to scraping the ATP World Tour&#39;s event page which displays the matches in an easy to access format. We&#39;ll be using the Wimbledon 2013 draw since Andy Murray won that year! This is what the page looks like:
  Each match is in its own row of a table and each column has a class attribute which makes it really easy to scrape.</description>

      <description>Continuing on from my blog post about scraping Neo4j&#39;s release dates I thought it&#39;d be even more interesting to chart the release dates of some github projects.
In theory the release dates should be accessible through the github API but the few that I looked at weren&#39;t returning any data so I scraped the data together.  We&#39;ll be using rvest again and I first wrote the following function to extract the release versions and dates from a single page: library(dplyr) library(rvest) process_page = function(releases, session) { rows = session %&amp;gt;% html_nodes(&amp;quot;ul.</description>

      <description>As part of my log analysis I wanted to get the Neo4j release dates which are accessible from the release notes and decided to try out Hadley Wickham&#39;s rvest scraping library which he released at the end of 2014.  rvest is based on Python&#39;s beautifulsoup which has become my scraping library of choice so I didn&#39;t find it too difficult to pick up. To start with we need to download the release notes locally so we don&#39;t have to go over the network when we&#39;re doing our scraping: download.</description>

      <description>In my continued playing around with web logs in R I wanted to process the logs for a day and see what the most popular URIs were.  I first read in all the lines using the read_lines function in readr and put the vector it produced into a data frame so I could process it using dplyr. library(readr) dlines = data.frame(column = read_lines(&amp;quot;~/projects/logs/2015-06-18-22-docs&amp;quot;))   In the previous post I showed some code to extract the URI from a log line.</description>

      <description>When refactoring code or looking for the best way to integrate a new piece of functionality I generally favour a small steps/incremental approach but recent experiences have led me to believe that this isn&#39;t always the quickest approach.  Sometimes it seems to make more sense to go on little discovery missions in the code, make some bigger steps and then if necessary retreat and revert our changes and apply the lessons learnt on our next discovery mission.</description>

      <description>Every few months we run a relational to graph meetup at the Neo London office where we go through how to take your data from a relational database and into the graph.  We use the Northwind dataset which often comes as a demo dataset on relational databases and come up with some queries which seem graph in nature.  My favourite query is one which finds out how employees are organised and who reports to whom.</description>

      <description>I recently finished reading Kelly McGonigal&#39;s excellent book &#39;The Willpower Instinct&#39; having previously watched her Google talk of the same title  My main takeaway from the book is that there are things that we want to do (or not do) but doing them (or not as the case may be) isn&#39;t necessarily instinctive and so we need to develop some strategies to help ourselves out.  In one of the early chapters she suggests picking a habit that you want to do less off and write down on a piece of paper every time you want to do it and how you&#39;re feeling at that point.</description>

      <description>During the Neo4j How I met your mother hackathon that we ran last week one of the attendees noticed that one of the CSV files we were importing wasn&#39;t creating as many records as they expected it to.  This is typically the case when there&#39;s some odd quoting in the CSV file but we decided to look into it. The file in question was one containing references made in HIMYM.</description>

      <description>Recently I was working with a CSV file which contained both Windows and Unix line endings which was making it difficult to work with.  The actual line endings were HEX &#39;0A0D&#39; i.e. Windows line breaks but there were also HEX &#39;OA&#39; i.e. Unix line breaks within one of the columns.  I wanted to get rid of the Unix line breaks and discovered that you can do HEX sequence replacement using the GNU version of sed - unfortunately the Mac ships with the BSD version which doesn&#39;t have this functionaltiy.</description>

This is what the file looked like: $ cat foo2.txt | head -n 5 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0   And the idea is that we would end up with something like this: &amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot;   The first thing we need to do is quote each of the values.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been working with Netty a bit recently and having built a pipeline of encoders/decoders as described in this excellent tutorial wanted to test that the encoders and decoders were working without having to send real messages around.
Luckily there is a EmbeddedChannel which makes our life very easy indeed.
Let&#39;s say we&#39;ve got a message &#39;Foo&#39; that we want to send across the wire. It only contains a single integer value so we&#39;ll just send that and reconstruct &#39;Foo&#39; on the other side.</description>

      <description>In late 2013 I wrote a post showing how to create a linked list connecting different football seasons together using Neo4j&#39;s Cypher query language, a post I&#39;ve frequently copy &amp; pasted from!  Now 18 months later, and using Neo4j 2.2 rather than 2.0, we can actually solve this problem in what I believe is a more intuitive way using the UNWIND function. Credit for the idea goes to Michael, I&#39;m just the messenger.</description>

      <description>A couple of weekends ago I started scraping the BBC live text feed of the Bayern Munich/Barcelona match, initially starting out with just the fouls and building the foul graph.  I&#39;ve spent a bit more time on it since then and have managed to model several other events as well including attempts, goals, cards and free kicks.  I started doing this just for the Bayern Munich/Barcelona match but realised it wasn&#39;t particularly difficult to extend this out and graph the events for every match in the Champions League 2014/2015.</description>

      <description>As part of the BBC live text scraping code I&#39;ve been working on I needed to take an iterator of raw events created by a generator and transform this into an iterator of cards shown in a match.  The structure of the raw events I&#39;m interested in is as follows:  Line 1: Player booked Line 2: Player fouled Line 3: Information about the foul   e.g. events = [ {&#39;event&#39;: u&#39;Booking Pedro (Barcelona) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.</description>

      <description>Last week I was showing the foul graph to my colleague Alistair who came up with the idea of running a &#39;foul revenge&#39; query to find out which players gained revenge for a foul with one of their own later in them match.  Queries like this are very path centric and therefore work well in a graph. To recap, this is what the foul graph looks like:    The first thing that we need to do is connect the fouls in a linked list based on time so that we can query their order more easily.</description>

      <description>In my previous blog post I described how I&#39;d refactored some scraping code I&#39;ve been working on to use iterators and ended up with a function which returned a generator containing all the events for one BBC live text match: match_id = &amp;quot;32683310&amp;quot; events = extract_events(&amp;quot;data/raw/%s&amp;quot; % (match_id)) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print type(events) &amp;lt;type &#39;generator&#39;&amp;gt;   The next thing I wanted to do is get the events for multiple matches which meant I needed to glue together multiple generators into one big generator.</description>

      <description>Over the last week I&#39;ve been building a set of scripts to scrape the events from the Bayern Munich/Barcelona game and I&#39;ve ended up with a few hundred lines of nested for statements, if statements and mutated lists. I thought it was about time I did a bit of refactoring. The following is a function which takes in a match file and spits out a collection of maps containing times &amp; events.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been trying to write some Python code to extract the players and the team they represented in the Bayern Munich/Barcelona match into a CSV file and had much more difficulty than I expected.  I have some scraping code (which is beyond the scope of this article) which gives me a list of (player, team) pairs that I want to write to disk. The contents of the list is as follows: $ python extract_players.</description>

      <description>One of the Cypher language features we show in Neo4j training courses is the shortest path function which allows you to find the shortest path in terms of number of relationships between two nodes.  Using the movie graph, which you can import via the &#39;:play movies&#39; command in the browser, we&#39;ll first create a &#39;KNOWS&#39; relationship between any people that have appeared in the same movie: MATCH (p1:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-&amp;gt;()&amp;lt;-[:ACTED_IN]-(p2:Person) MERGE (p1)-[:KNOWS]-(p2)  Now that we&#39;ve got that relationship we can easily find the shortest path between two people, say Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks:</description>

      <description>Yesterday I wrote about a Neo4j graph I&#39;ve started building which contains all the fouls committed in the Champions League game between Barcelona &amp; Bayern Munich and surrounding meta data.  While adding other events into the graph I realised that I&#39;d added some duplication in the model and the model could do with some refactoring to make it easier to use.  To recap, this is the model that we designed in the previous blog post:    The duplication is on the left hand side of the model - we model a foul as being committed by one player against another and then hook the foul back into the match.</description>

      <description>I recently came across the Partially Derivative podcast and in episode 17 they describe how Kirk Goldsberry scraped a bunch of data about shots in basketball matches then ran some analysis on that data.  It got me thinking that we might be able to do something similar for football matches and although event based data for football matches only comes from Opta, the BBC does expose some of them in live text feeds.</description>

      <description>Continuing with my analysis of the Neo4j London user group I wanted to drill into some individual meetups and see the makeup of the people attending those meetups with respect to the cohort they belong to.  I started by writing a function which would take in an event ID and output a bar chart showing the number of people who attended that event from each cohort.   We can work out the cohort that a member belongs to by querying for the first event they attended.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I had a go at doing some cohort analysis of the Neo4j London meetup group which was an interesting experiment but unfortunately resulted in a chart that was completely illegible.    I wasn&#39;t sure how to progress from there but a few days ago I came across the cohort heatmap which seemed like a better way of visualising things over time. The underlying idea is still the same - we&#39;ve comparing different cohorts of users against each other to see whether a change or intervention we did at a certain time had any impact.</description>

In particular I like its toString method which returns a binary representation of the values that we&#39;re storing in bytes, ints and longs.</description>

 if it&#39;s not hard you&#39;re not practicing me, April 2015   i.e. you should find the skill you&amp;rsquo;re currently practicing difficult otherwise you&amp;rsquo;re not stretching yourself and therefore aren&amp;rsquo;t getting better.</description>

e.g. imagine we have the following CDF represented in a data frame:
library(dplyr) df = data.frame(score = c(5,7,8,10,12,20), percentile = c(0.05,0.1,0.15,0.20,0.25,0.5))   and we want to find the minimum value for the 0.05 percentile. We can use the filter function to do so: &amp;gt; (df %&amp;gt;% filter(percentile &amp;gt; 0.</description>

One day you see a locomotive with the number 60. Estimate how many loco- motives the railroad has.   The interesting thing about this question is that it initially seems that we don&#39;t have enough information to come up with any sort of answer.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a post last week I&#39;ve been reading through Think Bayes and translating some of the examples form Python to R.  After my first post Antonios suggested a more idiomatic way of writing the function in R so I thought I&#39;d give it a try to calculate the probability that combinations of cookies had come from each bowl.  In the simplest case we have this function which takes in the names of the bowls and the likelihood scores: f = function(names,likelihoods) { # Assume each option has an equal prior priors = rep(1, length(names)) / length(names) # create a data frame with all info you have dt = data.</description>

      <description>About a year ago Ian pointed me at a Chicago Crime data set which seemed like a good fit for Neo4j and after much procrastination I&#39;ve finally got around to importing it.  The data set covers crimes committed from 2001 until now. It contains around 4 million crimes and meta data around those crimes such as the location, type of crime and year to name a few.  The contents of the file follow this structure: $ head -n 10 ~/Downloads/Crimes_-_2001_to_present.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been working through Alan Downey&#39;s Thinking Bayes and I thought it&#39;d be an interesting exercise to translate some of the code from Python to R.  The first example is a simple one about conditional probablity and the author creates a class &#39;PMF&#39; (Probability Mass Function) to solve the following problem:  Suppose there are two bowls of cookies. Bowl 1 contains 30 vanilla cookies and 10 chocolate cookies. Bowl 2 contains 20 of each.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I read a really cool blog post explaining how Markov chains can be used to model the possible state transitions in a game of snakes and ladders, a use of Markov chains I hadn&#39;t even thought of!  While the example is very helpful for understanding the concept, my understanding of the code is that it works off the assumption that any roll of the dice that puts you on a score  100 is a winning roll.</description>

      <description>Over the past couple of weeks I&#39;ve been reading about skill building and the break down of skills into more manageable chunks, and recently had a chance to break down the skills required to learn to cycle.  I initially sketched out the skill progression but quickly realised I had drawn a dependency graph and thought that putting it into Neo4j would simplify things.  I started out with the overall goal for cycling which was to &#39;Be able to cycle through a public park&#39;:</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I&#39;ve been reading about Markov Chains and I thought it&#39;d be an interesting exercise for me to translate Wikipedia&#39;s example into R code.  But first a definition:  A Markov chain is a random process that undergoes transitions from one state to another on a state space. It is required to possess a property that is usually characterized as &#34;memoryless&#34;: the probability distribution of the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it.</description>

      <description>After weeks of playing around with various algorithms to extract story arcs in How I met your mother I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that I don&#39;t yet have the skills to completely automate this process so I&#39;m going to change my approach.  The new plan is to treat the outputs of the algorithms as suggestions for possible themes but then have a manual step where I extract what I think are interesting themes in the series.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I spent the day in Berlin delivering a workshop as part of the Data Science Retreat and one of the exercises we did was write a query that would pull back all the information you&#39;d need to create the IMDB page for a movie.  Scanning the page we can see that need to get some basic meta data including the title. Next we&#39;ll need to pull in the actors, directors, producers and finally a recommendation for some other movies the viewer might like to see.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m planning to write a variant of the TF/IDF algorithm over the HIMYM corpus which weights in favour of term that appear in a medium number of documents and as a prerequisite needed a function that when given a number of documents would return a weighting.  It should return a higher value when a term appears in a medium number of documents i.e. if I pass in 10 I should get back a higher value than 200 as a term that appears in 10 episodes is likely to be more interesting than one which appears in almost every episode.</description>

      <description>One of the most common uses of Neo4j is for building real time recommendation engines and a common theme is that they make use of lots of different bits of data to come up with an interesting recommendation.  For example in this video Amanda shows how dating websites build real time recommendation engines by starting with social connections and then introducing passions, location and a few other things. Graph Aware have a neat framework that helps you to build your own recommendation engine using Java and I was curious what a Cypher version would look like.</description>

The instructions on the blog make it very easy to get up and running but as with other libraries I&#39;ve used, you have to specify how many topics the corpus consists of. I&#39;m never sure what value to select but the authors make the following suggestion:  How do you know the number of topics to search for?</description>

episodes = [ {&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 1, &amp;quot;topics&amp;quot;: [1,2,3]}, {&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 2, &amp;quot;topics&amp;quot;: [4,5,6]} ] flattened_episodes = [] for episode in episodes: for topic in episode[&amp;quot;topics&amp;quot;]: flattened_episodes.append({&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: episode[&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;], &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot;: topic}) for episode in flattened_episodes: print episode  If we run that we&#39;ll see this output:</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with topics models again and recently read a paper by David Mimno which suggested the following heuristic for working out which words should go onto the stop list:  A good heuristic for identifying such words is to remove those that occur in more than 5-10% of documents (most common) and those that occur fewer than 5-10 times in the entire corpus (least common).   I decided to try this out on the HIMYM dataset that I&#39;ve been working on over the last couple of months.</description>

for word_position, word in enumerate(words): print word_position, word  Python does make things extremely easy at times - you&#39;re welcome future Mark!</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been running a few intro to Neo4j training sessions recently using Neo4j 2.2.0 RC1 and at some stage in every session somebody will make a typo when writing out of the example queries.  For example one of the queries that we do about half way finds the actors and directors who have worked together and aggregates the movies they were in.  This is the correct query: MATCH (actor:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-&amp;gt;(movie)&amp;lt;-[:DIRECTED]-(director) RETURN actor.</description>

My technique for finding some of those people was to pick a person from the Neo4j kernel team who&#39;s very good at systems programming and uses twitter which led me to Mr Chris Vest.</description>

I started by translating one of wikipedia&#39;s TF/IDF examples to cypher to see what the algorithm would look like:
WITH 3 as termFrequency, 2 AS numberOfDocuments, 1 as numberOfDocumentsWithTerm WITH termFrequency, log10(numberOfDocuments / numberOfDocumentsWithTerm) AS inverseDocumentFrequency return termFrequency * inverseDocumentFrequency 0.</description>

      <description>Following on from Rik van Bruggen&#39;s blog post on a QCon graph he&#39;s created ahead of this week&#39;s conference, I was curious whether we could extract any interesting relationships between talks based on their abstracts.  Talks are already grouped by their hosting track but there&#39;s likely to be some overlap in topics even for talks on different tracks. I therefore wanted to extract topics and connect each talk to the topic that describes it best.</description>

      <description>Following on from my previous posts on training a classifier to pick out the speaker in sentences of HIMYM transcripts the next thing to do was train a random forest of decision trees to see how that fared.  I&#39;ve used scikit-learn for this before so I decided to use that. However, before building a random forest I wanted to check that I could build an equivalent decision tree.  I initially thought that scikit-learn&#39;s DecisionTree classifier would take in data in the same format as nltk&#39;s so I started out with the following code: import json import nltk import collections from himymutil.</description>

      <title>Python: Detecting the speaker in HIMYM using Parts of Speech (POS) tagging</title>

      <description>Over the last couple of weeks I&#39;ve been experimenting with different classifiers to detect speakers in HIMYM transcripts and in all my attempts so far the only features I&#39;ve used have been words.  This led to classifiers that were overfitted to the training data so I wanted to generalise them by introducing parts of speech of the words in sentences which are more generic.  First I changed the function which generates the features for each word to also contain the parts of speech of the previous and next words as well as the word itself: def pos_features(sentence, sentence_pos, i): features = {} features[&amp;quot;word&amp;quot;] = sentence[i] features[&amp;quot;word-pos&amp;quot;] = sentence_pos[i][1] if i == 0: features[&amp;quot;prev-word&amp;quot;] = &amp;quot;&amp;lt;START&amp;gt;&amp;quot; features[&amp;quot;prev-word-pos&amp;quot;] = &amp;quot;&amp;lt;START&amp;gt;&amp;quot; else: features[&amp;quot;prev-word&amp;quot;] = sentence[i-1] features[&amp;quot;prev-word-pos&amp;quot;] = sentence_pos[i-1][1] if i == len(sentence) - 1: features[&amp;quot;next-word&amp;quot;] = &amp;quot;&amp;lt;END&amp;gt;&amp;quot; features[&amp;quot;next-word-pos&amp;quot;] = &amp;quot;&amp;lt;END&amp;gt;&amp;quot; else: features[&amp;quot;next-word&amp;quot;] = sentence[i+1] features[&amp;quot;next-word-pos&amp;quot;] = sentence_pos[i+1][1] return features   Next we need to tweak our calling code to calculate the parts of speech tags for each sentence and pass it in: featuresets = [] for tagged_sent in tagged_sents: untagged_sent = nltk.</description>

      <description>As part of a talk I gave at the Neo4j London meetup earlier this week I wanted to show how you could build a simple chart showing the number of friends that different actors had using the ggplot library. I started out with the following code:
df = read.csv(&amp;quot;/tmp/friends.csv&amp;quot;) top = df %&amp;gt;% head(20) ggplot(aes(x = p.name, y = colleagues), data = top) + geom_bar(fill = &amp;quot;dark blue&amp;quot;, stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;)  The friends CSV file is available as a gist if you want to reproduce the chart.</description>

      <description>Last week I wrote a blog post describing a decision tree I&#39;d trained to detect the speakers in a How I met your mother transcript and after writing the post I wondered whether a simple classifier would do the job.  The simple classifier will work on the assumption that any word followed by a &#34;:&#34; is a speaker and anything else isn&#39;t. Here&#39;s the definition of a NaiveClassifier: import nltk from nltk import ClassifierI class NaiveClassifier(ClassifierI): def classify(self, featureset): if featureset[&#39;next-word&#39;] == &amp;quot;:&amp;quot;: return True else: return False  As you can see it only implements the classify method and executes a static check.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I came across a blog post explaining how to apply cohort analysis to customer retention using R and I thought it&#39;d be a fun exercise to calculate something similar for meetup attendees.  In the customer retention example we track customer purchases on a month by month basis and each customer is put into a cohort or bucket based on the first month they made a purchase in.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with dplyr over the weekend and wanted to extract the values from a data frame column to use in a later filtering step.  I had a data frame: library(dplyr) df = data.frame(userId = c(1,2,3,4,5), score = c(2,3,4,5,5))  And wanted to extract the userIds of those people who have a score greater than 3. I started with:
highScoringPeople = df %&amp;gt;% filter(score &amp;gt; 3) %&amp;gt;% select(userId) &amp;gt; highScoringPeople userId 1 3 2 4 3 5   And then filtered the data frame expecting to get back those 3 people: &amp;gt; df %&amp;gt;% filter(userId %in% highScoringPeople) [1] userId score &amp;lt;0 rows&amp;gt; (or 0-length row.</description>

      <description>Over the past couple of months I&#39;ve been playing around with How I met your mother transcripts and the most recent thing I&#39;ve been working on is how to extract the speaker for a particular sentence. This initially seemed like a really simple problem as most of the initial sentences I looked at weere structured like this: &amp;lt;speaker&amp;gt;: &amp;lt;sentence&amp;gt;   If there were all in that format then we could write a simple regular expression and then move on but unfortunately they aren&#39;t.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve previously written about extracting TF/IDF scores for phrases in documents using scikit-learn and the final step in that post involved writing the words into a CSV file for analysis later on.  I wasn&#39;t sure what the most appropriate tool of choice for that analysis was so I decided to explore the data using Python&#39;s pandas library and load it into Neo4j and write some Cypher queries. To do anything with Neo4j we need to first load the CSV file into the database.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been using Python&#39;s pandas library while exploring some CSV files and although for the most part I&#39;ve found it intuitive to use, I had trouble filtering a data frame based on checking whether a column value was in a list. A subset of one of the CSV files I&#39;ve been working with looks like this:
$ cat foo.csv &amp;quot;Foo&amp;quot; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  Loading it into a pandas data frame is reasonably simple:</description>

      <description>Over the past few weeks I&#39;ve been playing around with various NLP techniques to find interesting insights into How I met your mother from its transcripts and one technique that kept coming up is TF/IDF.
The Wikipedia definition reads like this:
 tf–idf, short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.</description>

      <description>Over the last few weeks I&#39;ve been using various NLP libraries to derive topics for my corpus of How I met your mother episodes without success and was therefore enthused to see the release of Prismatic&#39;s Interest Graph API  The Interest Graph API exposes a web service to which you feed a block of text and get back a set of topics and associated score.
It has been trained over the last few years with millions of articles that people share on their social media accounts and in my experience using Prismatic the topics have been very useful for finding new material to read.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I came across a tweet by Sean Taylor asking for a weather data set with a few years worth of recording and I was surprised to learn that R already has such a thing - the weatherData package. Winner is: @UTVilla! &amp;#10;library(weatherData)&amp;#10;df &amp;lt;- getWeatherForYear(&amp;quot;SFO&amp;quot;, 2013)&amp;#10;ggplot(df, aes(x=Date, y = Mean_TemperatureF)) + geom_line()
&amp;mdash; Sean J. Taylor (@seanjtaylor) January 22, 2015 
weatherData provides a thin veneer around the wunderground API and was exactly what I&#39;d been looking for to compare meetup at London&#39;s NoSQL against weather conditions that day.</description>

      <description>Normally when I&#39;m playing around with data sets in R I get out ggplot2 to plot some charts to get a feel for the data but having spent quite a bit of time with Python and How I met your mother transcripts I haven&#39;t created a single plot. I thought I&#39;d better change change that.  After a bit of searching around it seems that matplotlib is the go to library for this job and I thought an interesting thing to plot would be how often each of the main characters appear in each episode across the show.</description>

      <description>Following on from last week&#39;s blog post where I found the most popular words in How I met your mother transcripts, in this post we&#39;ll have a look at how we can pull out sentences and then phrases from our corpus. The first thing I did was tweak the scraping script to pull out the sentences spoken by characters in the transcripts.
Each dialogue is separated by two line breaks so we use that as our separator.</description>

In my case I was trying to work out how many times words occurred in a corpus so I had something like the following: &amp;gt;&amp;gt; from collections import Counter &amp;gt;&amp;gt; counter = Counter([&amp;quot;word1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;word2&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;word3&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;word1&amp;quot;]) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; print counter Counter({&#39;word1&#39;: 2, &#39;word3&#39;: 1, &#39;word2&#39;: 1})   I wanted to write a for loop to iterate over the counter and print the (key, value) pairs and started with the following: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for key, value in counter: .</description>

      <description>In part 3 of Kaggle&#39;s series on text analytics I needed to install scikit-learn and having done so ran into the following error when trying to use one of its classes: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer Traceback (most recent call last): File &amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; File &amp;quot;/Users/markneedham/projects/neo4j-himym/himym/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/__init__.py&amp;quot;, line 37, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; from . import __check_build ImportError: cannot import name __check_build  This error doesn&#39;t reveal very much but I found that when I exited the REPL and tried the same command again I got a different error which was a bit more useful:</description>

      <description>After reading Emil&#39;s blog post about dark data a few weeks ago I became intrigued about trying to find some structure in free text data and I thought How I met your mother&#39;s transcripts would be a good place to start. I found a website which has the transcripts for all the episodes and then having manually downloaded the two pages which listed all the episodes, wrote a script to grab each of the transcripts so I could use them on my machine.</description>

      <description>A common problem that people have when using Neo4j for social network applications is updating a person with their newly imported friends.  We&#39;ll have an array of friends that we want to connect to a single Person node. Assuming the following schema...
$ schema Indexes ON :Person(id) ONLINE No constraints  ...a simplified version would look like this: WITH range (2,1002) AS friends MERGE (p:Person {id: 1}) FOREACH(f IN friends | MERGE (friend:Person {id: f}) MERGE (friend)-[:FRIENDS]-&amp;gt;p);   If we execute that on an empty database we&#39;ll see something like this: +-------------------+ | No data returned.</description>

@markhneedham vectorise with pmin(pmax(dateToLookup - before, 0), pmax(after - dateToLookup, 0)) / dhours(1)
&amp;mdash; Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) December 14, 2014

I found the following articles useful for explaining vectorisation and why you might want to do it:</description>

      <description>In my last post I showed some examples using R&#39;s lubridate package and another problem it made really easy to solve was working out how close a particular date time was to the weekend.  I wanted to write a function which would return the previous Sunday or upcoming Saturday depending on which was closer.
lubridate&#39;s floor_date and ceiling_date functions make this quite simple. e.g. if we want to round the 18th December down to the beginning of the week and up to the beginning of the next week we could do the following: &amp;gt; library(lubridate) &amp;gt; floor_date(ymd(&amp;quot;2014-12-18&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;week&amp;quot;) [1] &amp;quot;2014-12-14 UTC&amp;quot; &amp;gt; ceiling_date(ymd(&amp;quot;2014-12-18&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;week&amp;quot;) [1] &amp;quot;2014-12-21 UTC&amp;quot;   For the date in the future we actually want to grab the Saturday rather than the Sunday so we&#39;ll subtract one day from that: &amp;gt; ceiling_date(ymd(&amp;quot;2014-12-18&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;week&amp;quot;) - days(1) [1] &amp;quot;2014-12-20 UTC&amp;quot;   Now let&#39;s put that together into a function which finds the closest weekend for a given date: findClosestWeekendDay = function(dateToLookup) { before = floor_date(dateToLookup, &amp;quot;week&amp;quot;) + hours(23) + minutes(59) + seconds(59) after = ceiling_date(dateToLookup, &amp;quot;week&amp;quot;) - days(1) if((dateToLookup - before) &amp;lt; (after - dateToLookup)) { before } else { after } } &amp;gt; findClosestWeekendDay(ymd_hms(&amp;quot;2014-12-13 13:33:29&amp;quot;)) [1] &amp;quot;2014-12-13 UTC&amp;quot; &amp;gt; findClosestWeekendDay(ymd_hms(&amp;quot;2014-12-14 18:33:29&amp;quot;)) [1] &amp;quot;2014-12-14 23:59:59 UTC&amp;quot; &amp;gt; findClosestWeekendDay(ymd_hms(&amp;quot;2014-12-15 18:33:29&amp;quot;)) [1] &amp;quot;2014-12-14 23:59:59 UTC&amp;quot; &amp;gt; findClosestWeekendDay(ymd_hms(&amp;quot;2014-12-17 11:33:29&amp;quot;)) [1] &amp;quot;2014-12-14 23:59:59 UTC&amp;quot; &amp;gt; findClosestWeekendDay(ymd_hms(&amp;quot;2014-12-17 13:33:29&amp;quot;)) [1] &amp;quot;2014-12-20 UTC&amp;quot; &amp;gt; findClosestWeekendDay(ymd_hms(&amp;quot;2014-12-19 13:33:29&amp;quot;)) [1] &amp;quot;2014-12-20 UTC&amp;quot;   I&#39;ve set the Sunday date at 23:59:59 so that I can use this date in the next step where we want to calculate how how many hours it is from the current date to the nearest weekend.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with date times in R recently and I wanted to derive a numeric representation for a given value to make it easier to see the correlation between time and another variable.  e.g. December 13th 2014 17:30 should return 17.5 since it&#39;s 17.5 hours since midnight.  Using the standard R libraries we would write the following code: &amp;gt; december13 = as.POSIXlt(&amp;quot;2014-12-13 17:30:00&amp;quot;) &amp;gt; as.numeric(december13 - trunc(december13, &amp;quot;day&amp;quot;), units=&amp;quot;hours&amp;quot;) [1] 17.</description>

      <description>I recently came across an excellent article written by Stian Haklev in which he describes things he wishes he&#39;d been told before starting out with R, one being to do all data clean up in code which I thought I&#39;d give a try.  My goal is to leave the raw data completely unchanged, and do all the transformation in code, which can be rerun at any time. While I&#39;m writing the scripts, I&#39;m often jumping around, selectively executing individual lines or code blocks, running commands to inspect the data in the REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop, where each command is executed as soon as you type enter, in the picture above it&#39;s the pane to the right), etc.</description>

 Hadoop&#39;s FileUtil#copyMerge function does take a String parameter but it adds this text to the end of each partition file which isn&#39;t quite what we want. However, if we copy that function into our own FileUtil class we can restructure it to do what we want:</description>

 The first bit is reasonably simple - we can just import the ggmap library and make a call to get_map: &amp;gt; library(ggmap) &amp;gt; sfMap = map = get_map(location = &#39;San Francisco&#39;, zoom = 12)     Next I wanted to show the outlines of the different San Francisco zip codes and came across a blog post by Paul Bidanset on Baltimore neighbourhoods which I was able to adapt.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve found myself working with large CSV files quite frequently and realising that my existing toolset didn&#39;t let me explore them quickly I thought I&#39;d spend a bit of time looking at Spark to see if it could help.
I&#39;m working with a crime data set released by the City of Chicago: it&#39;s 1GB in size and contains details of 4 million crimes:

      <description>Over the weekend I was playing around with dplyr and had the following data frame grouped by both columns:
&amp;gt; library(dplyr) &amp;gt; data = data.frame( letter = sample(LETTERS, 50000, replace = TRUE), number = sample (1:10, 50000, replace = TRUE) ) &amp;gt; data %&amp;gt;% count(letter, number) %&amp;gt;% head(20) Source: local data frame [20 x 3] Groups: letter letter number n 1 A 1 184 2 A 2 192 3 A 3 183 4 A 4 193 5 A 5 214 6 A 6 172 7 A 7 196 8 A 8 198 9 A 9 174 10 A 10 196 11 B 1 212 12 B 2 198 13 B 3 194 14 B 4 181 15 B 5 203 16 B 6 234 17 B 7 221 18 B 8 179 19 B 9 182 20 B 10 170  I wanted to add an extra column which would show what percentage of the values for that letter each number had.</description>

      <description>In my continued work with R&#39;s dplyr I wanted to be able to group a data frame by some columns and then find the maximum value for each group.
We&#39;ll continue with my favourite dummy data set:
&amp;gt; library(dplyr) &amp;gt; data = data.frame( letter = sample(LETTERS, 50000, replace = TRUE), number = sample (1:10, 50000, replace = TRUE) )  I started with the following code to count how many occurrences of each (letter, number) pair there were:</description>

library(dplyr) data = data.frame( letter = sample(LETTERS, 50000, replace = TRUE), number = sample (1:10, 50000, replace = TRUE) )  And I wanted to find out how many occurrences of each (letter, number) pair exist in the data set.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been looking back over some of the early code I wrote using R before I knew about the dplyr library and thought it&#39;d be an interesting exercise to refactor some of the snippets.
We&#39;ll use the following data frame for each of the examples:
library(dplyr) data = data.frame( letter = sample(LETTERS, 50000, replace = TRUE), number = sample (1:10, 50000, replace = TRUE) )  Take {n} rows &amp;gt; data[1:5,] letter number 1 R 7 2 Q 3 3 B 8 4 R 3 5 U 2  becomes:</description>

      <description>A few months ago I wrote a blog explaining how to dynamically/programatically group a data frame by a field using dplyr but that approach has been deprecated in the latest version.
To recap, the original function looked like this:
library(dplyr) groupBy = function(df, field) { df %.% regroup(list(field)) %.% summarise(n = n()) }  And if we execute that with a sample data frame we&#39;ll see the following:

LDS stands for &#39;Logical Data Structure&#39; which is a diagram depicting what kinds of data some person or group wants to remember. In other words, a tool to help derive the conceptual model for our domain.

 Beware of the eager pipe  This is something that my colleague Michael noted in the second of his blog posts explaining how to use LOAD CSV successfully:</description>

      <description>A question which sometimes comes up when discussing graph data modelling is how you go about modelling sub/super types.
In my experience there are two reasons why we might want to do this:
 To ensure that certain properties exist on bits of data To write drill down queries based on those types  At the moment the former isn&#39;t built into Neo4j and you&#39;d only be able to achieve it by wiring up some code in a pre commit hook of a transaction event handler so we&#39;ll focus on the latter.</description>

I started with a date in this format:

      <description>An approach to modelling that I often see while working with Neo4j users is creating very generic relationships (e.g. HAS, CONTAINS, IS) and filtering on a relationship property or on a property/label at the end node.
Intuitively this doesn&#39;t seem to make best use of the graph model as it means that you have to evaluate many relationships and nodes that you&#39;re not interested in. However, I&#39;ve never actually tested the performance differences between the approaches so I thought I&#39;d try it out.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite functions in Neo4j&#39;s cypher query language is COLLECT which allows us to group items into an array for later consumption.
However, I&#39;ve noticed that people sometimes have trouble working out how to collect multiple items with COLLECT and struggle to find a way to do so.
Consider the following data set:
create (p:Person {name: &amp;quot;Mark&amp;quot;}) create (e1:Event {name: &amp;quot;Event1&amp;quot;, timestamp: 1234}) create (e2:Event {name: &amp;quot;Event2&amp;quot;, timestamp: 4567}) create (p)-[:EVENT]-&amp;gt;(e1) create (p)-[:EVENT]-&amp;gt;(e2)  If we wanted to return each person along with a collection of the event names they&#39;d participated in we could write the following:</description>

      <title>Neo4j: LOAD CSV - Column is null</title>

      <description>One problem I&#39;ve seen a few people have recently when using Neo4j&#39;s LOAD CSV function is dealing with CSV files that have dodgy hidden characters at the beginning of the header line.
For example, consider an import of this CSV file:
$ cat ~/Downloads/dodgy.csv userId,movieId 1,2  We might start by checking which columns it has:
$ load csv with headers from &amp;quot;file:/Users/markneedham/Downloads/dodgy.csv&amp;quot; as line return line; +----------------------------------+ | line | +----------------------------------+ | {userId -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, movieId -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;2&amp;quot;} | +----------------------------------+ 1 row  Looks good so far but what about if we try to return just &#39;userId&#39;?</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been learning how to do moving averages in R and having done that calculation I wanted to plot these variables on a line chart using ggplot.
The vector of rolling averages looked like this:
&amp;gt; rollmean(byWeek$n, 4) [1] 3.75 2.00 1.25 1.00 1.25 1.25 1.75 1.75 1.75 2.50 2.25 2.75 3.50 2.75 2.75 [16] 2.25 1.50 1.50 2.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 1.25 1.50 2.25 2.50 3.00 3.25 2.75 4.00 [31] 4.</description>

      <description>A common problem that people encounter when trying to import CSV files into Neo4j using Cypher&#39;s LOAD CSV command is how to handle empty or &#39;null&#39; entries in said files.
For example let&#39;s try and import the following file which has 3 columns, 1 populated, 2 empty:
$ cat /tmp/foo.csv a,b,c mark,,  load csv with headers from &amp;quot;file:/tmp/foo.csv&amp;quot; as row MERGE (p:Person {a: row.a}) SET p.b = row.b, p.c = row.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I&#39;ve been trying to write some code to help me create and share a Google Drive spreadsheet and for the first bit Istarted out with the Google Drive gem.
This worked reasonably well but that gem doesn&#39;t have an API for changing the permissions on a document so I ended up using the google-api-client gem for that bit.
This tutorial provides a good quick start for getting up and running but it still has a manual step to copy/paste the &#39;OAuth token&#39; which I wanted to get rid of.</description>

I eventually came across this StackOverflow post which shows how to do it:</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been working with Neo4j full time for slightly more than a year now and from interacting with the community I&#39;ve noticed that while using different features of the product people fall into 4 categories.
These are as follows:
  On one axis we have &#39;loudness&#39; i.e. how vocal somebody is either on twitter, StackOverflow or by email and on the other we have &#39;success&#39; which is how well a product feature is working for them.</description>

I wanted to find a better way.
To recap, I came up with the following charts showing the RSVPs to Neo4j London meetup events using this code:
  The first thing we need to do to simplify chart generation is to return &#39;yes&#39; and &#39;no&#39; responses in the same cypher query, like so:</description>

public class Chains { public static void main(String[] args) { String simpleChains = &amp;quot;/tmp/longchains&amp;quot;; populate( simpleChains, 10000 ); } private static void populate( String path, int chainSize ) { GraphDatabaseService db = new GraphDatabaseFactory().</description>

I thought it&#39;d be interesting to create some visualisations around the times that people RSVP &#39;yes&#39; to the various Neo4j events that we run in London.
I started off with the following query which returns the date time that people replied &#39;Yes&#39; to an event and the date time of the event:</description>

      <description>In my continued playing around with R I wanted to map a custom function over two lists comparing each item with its corresponding items.
If we just want to use a built in function such as subtraction between two lists it&#39;s quite easy to do:
&amp;gt; c(10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1) - c(5,4,3,4,3,2,2,1,2,1) [1] 5 5 5 3 3 3 2 2 0 0  I wanted to do a slight variation on that where instead of returning the difference I wanted to return a text value representing the difference e.</description>

      <description>I was recently asked how to process an &#39;array&#39; of values inside a column in a CSV file using Neo4j&#39;s LOAD CSV tool and although I initially thought this wouldn&#39;t be possible as every cell is treated as a String, Michael showed me a way of working around this which I thought was pretty neat.
 Let&#39;s say we have a CSV file representing people and their friends. It might look like this: name,friends &amp;quot;Mark&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Michael,Peter&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Michael&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Peter,Kenny&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Kenny&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Anders,Michael&amp;quot;  And what we want is to have the following nodes:</description>

      <description>In my continued playing around with plyr&#39;s ddply function I was trying to group a data frame by one of its columns and return a count of the number of rows with specific values and ran into a strange (to me) error message.
I had a data frame:
n = c(2, 3, 5) s = c(&amp;quot;aa&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bb&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cc&amp;quot;) b = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) df = data.frame(n, s, b)  And wanted to group and count on column &#39;b&#39; so I&#39;d get back a count of 2 for TRUE and 1 for FALSE.</description>

      <description>On Nicole&#39;s recommendation I&#39;ve been having a look at R&#39;s plyr package to see if I could simplify my meetup analysis and I started by translating my code that grouped meetup join dates by day of the week.
To refresh, the code without plyr looked like this:
library(Rneo4j) timestampToDate &amp;lt;- function(x) as.POSIXct(x / 1000, origin=&amp;quot;1970-01-01&amp;quot;) query = &amp;quot;MATCH (:Person)-[:HAS_MEETUP_PROFILE]-&amp;gt;()-[:HAS_MEMBERSHIP]-&amp;gt;(membership)-[:OF_GROUP]-&amp;gt;(g:Group {name: \&amp;quot;Neo4j - London User Group\&amp;quot;}) RETURN membership.joined AS joinDate&amp;quot; meetupMembers = cypher(graph, query) meetupMembers$joined &amp;lt;- timestampToDate(meetupMembers$joinDate) dd = aggregate(meetupMembers$joined, by=list(format(meetupMembers$joined, &amp;quot;%A&amp;quot;)), function(x) length(x)) colnames(dd) = c(&amp;quot;dayOfWeek&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;count&amp;quot;)  which returns the following:</description>

      <description>In continuing my analysis of the London Neo4j meetup group using R I wanted to see which days of the week we organise meetups and how many people RSVP affirmatively by the day.
I started out with this query which returns each event and the number of &#39;yes&#39; RSVPS:
library(Rneo4j) timestampToDate &amp;lt;- function(x) as.POSIXct(x / 1000, origin=&amp;quot;1970-01-01&amp;quot;) query = &amp;quot;MATCH (g:Group {name: \&amp;quot;Neo4j - London User Group\&amp;quot;})-[:HOSTED_EVENT]-&amp;gt;(event)&amp;lt;-[:TO]-({response: &#39;yes&#39;})&amp;lt;-[:RSVPD]-() WHERE (event.time + event.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been doing some ad-hoc analysis of the Neo4j London meetup group using R and Neo4j and having worked out how to group by certain keys the next step was to order the rows of the data frame.
I wanted to drill into the days on which people join the group and see whether they join it at a specific time of day. My feeling was that most people would join on a Monday morning.</description>

      <description>I wanted to do some ad-hoc analysis on the join date of members of the Neo4j London meetup group and since cypher doesn&#39;t yet have functions for dealings with dates I thought I&#39;d give R a try.
I started off by executing a cypher query which returned the join timestamp of all the group members using Nicole White&#39;s RNeo4j package:
&amp;gt; library(Rneo4j) &amp;gt; query = &amp;quot;match (:Person)-[:HAS_MEETUP_PROFILE]-&amp;gt;()-[:HAS_MEMBERSHIP]-&amp;gt;(membership)-[:OF_GROUP]-&amp;gt;(g:Group {name: \&amp;quot;Neo4j - London User Group\&amp;quot;}) RETURN membership.</description>

To refresh, we wanted to find all the people in the London office that I hadn&#39;t worked with given this model...
   ...and this initial query:
MATCH (p:Person {name: &amp;quot;me&amp;quot;})-[:MEMBER_OF]-&amp;gt;(office {name: &amp;quot;London Office&amp;quot;})&amp;lt;-[:MEMBER_OF]-(colleague) WHERE NOT (p-[:COLLEAGUES]-&amp;gt;(colleague)) RETURN COUNT(colleague)  This took on average 7.</description>

A good example of this is in the meetup application I&#39;ve been working on. I have a collection of events and want to display past events in descending order and future events in ascending order.</description>

One example of this was the query I used to generate the data for the following page of the meetup application I&#39;ve been working on:
    Depending on the selected tab you can choose to see the people signed up for the meetup and the date that they signed up or the topics that those people are interested in.</description>

      <description>While building up the Neo4j World Cup Graph I&#39;ve been making use of the LOAD CSV function and I frequently found myself needing to do different things depending on the value in one of the columns.
For example I have one CSV file which contains the different events that can happen in a football match:
match_id,player,player_id,time,type &amp;quot;1012&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Antonin Panenka&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;174835&amp;quot;,21,&amp;quot;penalty&amp;quot; &amp;quot;1012&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Faisal Al Dakhil&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;2204&amp;quot;,57,&amp;quot;goal&amp;quot; &amp;quot;102&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Roger Milla&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;79318&amp;quot;,106,&amp;quot;goal&amp;quot; &amp;quot;102&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Roger Milla&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;79318&amp;quot;,108,&amp;quot;goal&amp;quot; &amp;quot;102&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Bernardo Redin&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;44555&amp;quot;,115,&amp;quot;goal&amp;quot; &amp;quot;102&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Andre Kana-biyik&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;174649&amp;quot;,44,&amp;quot;yellow&amp;quot;  If the type is &#39;penalty&#39;, &#39;owngoal&#39; or &#39;goal&#39; then I want to create a SCORED_GOAL relationship whereas if it&#39;s &#39;yellow&#39;, &#39;yellowred&#39; or &#39;red&#39; then I want to create a RECEIVED_CARD relationship instead.</description>

Zach explains that a lecture based approach isn&#39;t necessarily the most effective way for people to learn and that half of the people attending the meetup are likely to be novices and would struggle to follow more advanced content.

Let&#39;s say we&#39;ve created a timetree up front and now have a series of events coming in that we want to create in the database and attach to the appropriate part of the timetree.</description>

      <description>Every now and then I get sent Neo4j cypher queries to look at and more often than not they&#39;re parameterised which means you can&#39;t easily run them in the Neo4j browser.
For example let&#39;s say we have a database which has a user called &#39;Mark&#39;:
CREATE (u:User {name: &amp;quot;Mark&amp;quot;})  Now we write a query to find &#39;Mark&#39; with the name parameterised so we can easily search for a different user in future:</description>

      <description>One of my favourite features of Clojure is that it allows you to destructure a data structure into values that are a bit easier to work with.
I often find myself referring to Jay Fields&#39; article which contains several examples showing the syntax and is a good starting point.
One recent use of destructuring I had was where I was working with a vector containing events like this:
user&amp;gt; (def events [{:name &amp;quot;e1&amp;quot; :timestamp 123} {:name &amp;quot;e2&amp;quot; :timestamp 456} {:name &amp;quot;e3&amp;quot; :timestamp 789}])  I wanted to split the events in two - those containing events with a timestamp greater than 123 and those less than or equal to 123.</description>

      <description>About 6 months ago Jacqui Read created a github issue explaining how she wanted to round a float value to a number of decimal places but was unable to do so due to the round function not taking the appropriate parameter.
I found myself wanting to do the same thing last week where I initially had the following value:
RETURN toFloat(&amp;quot;12.336666&amp;quot;) AS value  I wanted to round that to 2 decimal places and Wes suggested multiplying the value before using ROUND and then dividing afterwards to achieve that.</description>

      <description>When Neo4j 2.1 is released we&#39;ll have the UNWIND clause which makes working with collections of things easier.
In my blog post about creating adjacency matrices we wanted to show how many people were members of the first 5 meetup groups ordered alphabetically and then check how many were members of each of the other groups.
Without the UNWIND clause we&#39;d have to do this:
MATCH (g:Group) WITH g ORDER BY g.</description>

      <description>I spent much longer than I should have done trying to work out how to create a directory in Clojure as part of an import script I&#39;m working out so for my future self this is how you do it:
(.mkdir (java.io.File. &amp;quot;/path/to/dir/to/create&amp;quot;))  I&#39;m creating a directory which contains today&#39;s date so I&#39;d want something like &#39;members-2014-05-24&#39; if I was running it today. The clj-time library is very good for working with dates.</description>

      <description>About 9 months ago I wrote a blog post showing how to export an adjacency matrix from a Neo4j 1.9 database using the cypher query language and I thought it deserves an update to use 2.0 syntax.
I&#39;ve been spending some of my free time working on an application that runs on top of meetup.com&#39;s API and one of the queries I wanted to write was to find the common members between 2 meetup groups.</description>

      <description>About a year ago I wrote a blog post showing how to stream a HTTP response using Jersey/Jax RS and I recently wanted to do the same thing but this time using JSON.
A common pattern is to take our Java object and get a JSON string representation of that but that isn&#39;t the most efficient use of memory because we now have the Java object and a string representation.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with the meetup API to do some analysis on the Neo4j London meetup and one thing I wanted to do was download all the members of the group. A feature of the meetup API is that each end point will only allow you to return a maximum of 200 records so I needed to make use of offsets and paging to retrieve everybody.
 It seemed like a good chance to use some lazy sequences to keep track of the offsets and then stop making calls to the API once I wasn&#39;t retrieving any more results.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been using the clj-time library recently - a Clojure wrapper around Joda Time - and one thing I wanted to do is format a date with day suffixes e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd.
I started with the following timestamp:
1309368600000  The first step was to convert that into a DateTime object like so:
user&amp;gt; (require &#39;[clj-time.coerce :as c]) user&amp;gt; (c/from-long 1309368600000) #&amp;lt;DateTime 2011-06-29T17:30:00.000Z&amp;gt;  I wanted to output that date in the following format:</description>

      <description>Every now and then in Cypher land we&#39;ll end up with a collection of arrays, often created via the COLLECT function, that we want to squash down into one array.
For example let&#39;s say we have the following array of arrays...
$ RETURN [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]] AS result; ==&amp;gt; +---------------------------+ ==&amp;gt; | result | ==&amp;gt; +---------------------------+ ==&amp;gt; | [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] | ==&amp;gt; +---------------------------+ ==&amp;gt; 1 row  ...and we want to return the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].</description>

The domain I want to model is RSVPs to meetup invites - I want to understand how much in advance people respond and how likely they are to drop out at a later stage.</description>

This was easy enough when both collections contained values...

      <description>When working with graphs we&#39;ll frequently find ourselves wanting to create relationships between collections of nodes.
A common example of this would be creating a linked list of days so that we can quickly traverse across a time tree. Let&#39;s say we start with just 3 days:
MERGE (day1:Day {day:1 }) MERGE (day2:Day {day:2 }) MERGE (day3:Day {day:3 }) RETURN day1, day2, day3  And we want to create a &#39;NEXT&#39; relationship between adjacent days:</description>

My first query started with a map and I wanted to create a person from an identifier inside the map:
WITH {person: {id: 1}} AS params MERGE (p:Person {id: params.person.id}) RETURN p  When I ran the query I got this error:

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing with Clojure over the weekend and got caught out by the behaviour of lazy sequences due to chunking - something which was obvious to experienced Clojurians although not me.
I had something similar to the following bit of code which I expected to only evaluate the first item of the infinite sequence that the range function generates:

      <description>yourkit is my favourite JVM profiling tool and whilst it&#39;s really easy to profile a local JVM process, sometimes I need to profile a process on a remote machine.
In that case we need to first have the remote JVM started up with a yourkit agent parameter passed as one of the args to the Java program.
Since I&#39;m mostly working with Neo4j this means we need to add the following to conf/neo4j-wrapper.</description>

A big chunk of the book focuses on lambdas, functional collection parameters and lazy evaluation which will be familiar to users of C#, Clojure, Scala, Haskell, Ruby, Python, F# or libraries like totallylazy and Guava.</description>

      <description>Last week we released the first milestone of Neo4j 2.1.0 and one its features is a new function in cypher - LOAD CSV - which aims to make it easier to get data into Neo4j.
I thought I&#39;d give it a try to import the London tube graph - something that my colleague Rik wrote about a few months ago.
I&#39;m using the same data set as Rik but I had to tweak it a bit as there were naming differences when describing the connection from Kennington to Waterloo and Kennington to Oval.</description>

      <description>Last week Alistair and I were porting some Neo4j cypher queries from 1.8 to 2.0 and one of the queries we had to change was an interesting one that created a bunch of relationships from a list/array of maps.
In the query we had a user &#39;Mark&#39; and wanted to create &#39;FRIENDS_WITH&#39; relationships to Peter and Michael.
  The application passed in a list of maps representing Peter and Michael as a parameter but if we remove the parameters the query looked like this:</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve recently spent a bit of time working with people on their graph commons and a common pattern I&#39;ve come across is that although the models have lots of relationships there are often missing nodes.
Emails We&#39;ll start with a model which represents the emails that people send between each other. A first cut might look like this:
  The problem with this approach is that we haven&#39;t modelled the concept of an email - that&#39;s been implicitly modelled via a relationship.</description>

      <description>At the end of last year I was playing around with running scheduled tasks to monitor a Neo4j cluster and one of the problems I ran into was that the monitoring would sometimes exit.
I eventually realised that this was because a RuntimeException was being thrown inside the Runnable method and I wasn&#39;t handling it. The following code demonstrates the problem:
import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; import java.util.concurrent.*; public class RunnableBlog { public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException { ScheduledExecutorService executor = Executors.</description>

The updated model looks like this:

      <description>One of the features added into the more recent versions of Neo4j&#39;s cypher query language is the ability to tell Cypher which index you&#39;d like to use in your queries.
We&#39;ll use the football dataset, so let&#39;s start by creating an index on the &#39;name&#39; property of nodes labelled &#39;Player&#39;:
CREATE INDEX ON :Player(name)  Let&#39;s say we want to write a query to find &#39;Wayne Rooney&#39; while explicitly using this index.</description>

      <description>Earlier in the week I wanted to work out the serialVersionUID of a serializable class so that I could override its toString method without breaking everything.
I came across Frank Kim&#39;s blog post which suggested using the serialver tool which comes with the JDK.
I created a little Maven project to test this tool out on a very simple class:
import java.io.Serializable; public class SerialiseMe implements Serializable { }  If we compile that class into a JAR and then run the serialver tool we see the following output:</description>

      <description>Recently I&#39;ve been spending a reasonable chunk of my time helping people get up and running with their Neo4j High Availability cluster and there&#39;s sometimes confusion around how it should be configured.
A Neo4j cluster typically consists of a master and two slaves and you&#39;d usually have it configured so that any machine can be the master.
However, there is a configuration parameter &#39;ha.slave_only&#39; which can be set to &#39;true&#39; to ensure that a machine will never be elected as master when an election takes place.</description>

      <description>One of the lesser known things about the Neo4j online backup tool, which I wrote about last week, is that conceptually there are two parts to it:
 Copying the store files to a location of your choice Verifying that those store files are consistent.  By default both of these run when you run the &#39;neo4j-backup&#39; script but sometimes it&#39;s useful to be able to run them separately.
If we want to just run the copying the store files part of the process we can tell the backup tool to skip the consistency check by using the &#39;verify&#39; flag:</description>

      <description>(as Gabriel points out in the comments the ability to do a &#39;HA backup&#39; doesn&#39;t exist in more recent versions of Neo4j. I&#39;ll leave this post here for people still running on older versions who encounter the error.)
When using Neo4j&#39;s online backup facility there are two ways of triggering it, either by using the &#39;single://&#39; or &#39;ha://&#39; syntax and these behave slightly differently.
If you&#39;re using the &#39;single://&#39; syntax and don&#39;t specify a port then it will connect to &#39;6362&#39; by default:</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago Alistair and I were working on the code used to model the labels that a node has attached to it in a Neo4j database.
The way this works is that chunks of 32 nodes ids are represented as a 32 bit bitmap for each label where a 1 for a bit means that a node has the label and a 0 means that it doesn&#39;t.
For example, let&#39;s say we have node ids 0-31 where 0 is the highest bit and 31 is the lowest bit.</description>

It seems to have grown in popularity recently and I noticed that&#39;s there&#39;s now a Java version called RxJava written by Netflix.
I thought I&#39;d give it a try by changing some code I wrote while exploring cypher&#39;s MERGE function to expose an Observable instead of Futures.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks about I wrote about cypher&#39;s MERGE function and over the last few days I&#39;ve been exploring how it works when used with schema indexes and unique constraints.
A common use case with Neo4j is to model users and events where an event could be a tweet, Facebook post or Pinterest pin. The model might look like this:
 We&#39;d have a stream of (user, event) pairs and a cypher statement like the following to get the data into Neo4j:</description>

Since then I&#39;ve been working on support for Neo4j customers and I&#39;ve realised that there are a couple of other things to keep in mind while debugging production problems that I missed from the initial list.
Keep a clear head / Hold back your assumptions The first is that it&#39;s very helpful to completely clear your head of any assumptions when looking at a problem.</description>

Luckily Ian Robinson showed me a mini-algorithm which I found helpful for getting started. The steps are as follows:

      <description>In a couple of Neo4j talks I&#39;ve done recently I&#39;ve been asked how long it takes to get used to modelling data in graphs and whether I felt it&#39;s simpler than alternative approaches.
My experience of &#39;thinking in graphs&#39;™ closely mirrors what I believe is a fairly common curve when learning technologies which change the way you think:
 There is an initial stage where it seems really hard because it&#39;s different to what we&#39;re used to and at this stage we might want to go back to what we&#39;re used to.</description>

      <description>One of the common problems when building data heavy applications is that names of things in the domain are often named differently depending on which system you get the data from.
This means that we&#39;ll typically end up running the data from different sources through a normalisation process to ensure that we have consistent naming in the database:
 I&#39;ve recently started linking the football stadium a match was played in to the match in my football graph but unfortunately different match compilers use different spellings or even names for the same stadium.</description>

      <description>One of the breaking changes in Neo4j 2.0.0-RC1 compared to previous versions is that the -[?]- syntax for matching optional relationships has been retired and replaced with the OPTIONAL MATCH construct.
An example where we might want to match an optional relationship could be if we want to find colleagues that we haven&#39;t worked with given the following model:
 Suppose we have the following data set:
CREATE (steve:Person {name: &amp;quot;Steve&amp;quot;}) CREATE (john:Person {name: &amp;quot;John&amp;quot;}) CREATE (david:Person {name: &amp;quot;David&amp;quot;}) CREATE (paul:Person {name: &amp;quot;Paul&amp;quot;}) CREATE (sam:Person {name: &amp;quot;Sam&amp;quot;}) CREATE (londonOffice:Office {name: &amp;quot;London Office&amp;quot;}) CREATE UNIQUE (steve)-[:WORKS_IN]-&amp;gt;(londonOffice) CREATE UNIQUE (john)-[:WORKS_IN]-&amp;gt;(londonOffice) CREATE UNIQUE (david)-[:WORKS_IN]-&amp;gt;(londonOffice) CREATE UNIQUE (paul)-[:WORKS_IN]-&amp;gt;(londonOffice) CREATE UNIQUE (sam)-[:WORKS_IN]-&amp;gt;(londonOffice) CREATE UNIQUE (steve)-[:COLLEAGUES_WITH]-&amp;gt;(john) CREATE UNIQUE (steve)-[:COLLEAGUES_WITH]-&amp;gt;(david)  We might write the following query to find people from the same office as Steve but that he hasn&#39;t worked with:</description>

      <description>We recently released Neo4j 2.0.0-RC1 and since there were some breaking changes from Neo4j 2.0.0-M06 I decided to check if I needed to update any of my football graph queries.
On query which no longer worked as I expected was the following one which calculated the top goal scorers for televised games:
MATCH (player:Player)-[:played|subbed_on]-&amp;gt;stats WITH stats.goals AS goals, player, stats-[:in]-&amp;gt;()-[:on_tv]-() as onTv RETURN player.name, SUM(CASE WHEN onTv = FALSE THEN goals ELSE 0 END) as nonTvGoals, SUM(CASE WHEN onTv = TRUE THEN goals ELSE 0 END) as tvGoals, SUM(goals) as allGoals ORDER BY tvGoals DESC LIMIT 10  This is what that section of the graph looks like visually:</description>

      <description>I want to introduce the concept of a season into my graph so I can have import matches for multiple years and then vary the time period which queries take into account.
I started by creating season nodes like this:
CREATE (:Season {name: &amp;quot;2013/2014&amp;quot;, timestamp: 1375315200}) CREATE (:Season {name: &amp;quot;2012/2013&amp;quot;, timestamp: 1343779200}) CREATE (:Season {name: &amp;quot;2011/2012&amp;quot;, timestamp: 1312156800}) CREATE (:Season {name: &amp;quot;2010/2011&amp;quot;, timestamp: 1280620800}) CREATE (:Season {name: &amp;quot;2009/2010&amp;quot;, timestamp: 1249084800})  I wanted to add a &#39;NEXT&#39; relationship between the seasons so that I could have an in graph season index which would allow me to write queries like the following:</description>

      <description>Recently I&#39;ve spent some time building a set of tests around rolling upgrades between Neo4j versions and as part of that I wanted to log the state of the cluster as the upgrade was happening.
The main thread of the test blocks waiting until the upgrade is done so I wanted to log on another thread every few seconds. Alistair pointed me at the ScheduledExecutorService which worked quite nicely.
I ended up with a test which looked roughly like this:</description>

      <description>In the last post I wrote about Nathan and my attempts at the Kaggle Titanic Problem I mentioned that we our next step was to try out scikit-learn so I thought I should summarise where we&#39;ve got up to.
We needed to write a classification algorithm to work out whether a person onboard the Titanic survived and luckily scikit-learn has extensive documentation on each of the algorithms.
Unfortunately almost all those examples use numpy data structures and we&#39;d loaded the data using pandas and didn&#39;t particularly want to switch back!</description>

      <description>Wes has been teaching me some of his tricks for tuning Neo4j cypher queries over the last few weeks so I thought I should write up a few examples of the master&#39;s advice in action.
I&#39;ve created a mini benchmarking tool using Python&#39;s timeit and numpy to run different queries multiple times and return the mean, min, max and 95th percentile times.
I&#39;ve made my football data set available in case you want to follow along and we&#39;ll start with a query to find the top goal scorers away from home.</description>

      <description>Nathan and I have been playing around with different scikit-learn machine learning classifiers and we wanted to run different combinations of features through each one and work out which gave the best result.
We started with a list of features:
all_columns = [&amp;quot;Fare&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Sex&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Pclass&amp;quot;, &#39;Embarked&#39;]  itertools#combinations allows us to create combinations with a length of our choice:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import itertools as it &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list(it.combinations(all_columns, 3)) [(&#39;Fare&#39;, &#39;Sex&#39;, &#39;Pclass&#39;), (&#39;Fare&#39;, &#39;Sex&#39;, &#39;Embarked&#39;), (&#39;Fare&#39;, &#39;Pclass&#39;, &#39;Embarked&#39;), (&#39;Sex&#39;, &#39;Pclass&#39;, &#39;Embarked&#39;)]  We wanted to create combinations of arbitrary length so we wanted to combine a few invocations of that functions like this:</description>

Since this problem brings together three types of data - order history, stock levels and products - it seems like it should be a nice fit for Neo4j so I &#39;graphed up&#39; a quick example.</description>

The problem we had with numpy is that you use integers to reference columns. We spent a lot of time being thoroughly confused as to why something wasn&#39;t working only to realise we were using the wrong column.</description>

The book starts by describing our two styles of thinking...
 System 1 – operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.  System 2 – allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations.</description>

      <description>Something I&#39;ve seen people get confused by when writing queries using Neo4j&#39;s cypher query language is the sometimes significant difference in query execution time when using &#39;LIMIT&#39; on its own compared to using it in combination with &#39;ORDER BY&#39;.
The confusion is centred around the fact that at first glance it seems like the only thing different between these queries is the sorting of the rows but there&#39;s actually more to it.</description>

      <description>I recently read Michal Bachman&#39;s post about bidirectional relationships in Neo4j in which he suggests that for some relationship types we&#39;re not that interested in the relationship&#39;s direction and can therefore ignore it when querying.
He uses the following example showing the partnership between Neo Technology and GraphAware:
 Both companies are partners with each other but since we can just as quickly find incoming and outgoing relationships we may as well just have one relationship between the two companies/nodes.</description>

      <description>At the Graph Database meet up in Antwerp last week we discussed how you would model a hyper edge in a property graph like Neo4j and I realised that I&#39;d done this in my football graph without realising.
A hyper edge is defined as follows:
 A hyperedge is a connection between two or more vertices, or nodes, of a hypergraph. A hypergraph is a graph in which generalized edges (called hyperedges) may connect more than two nodes with discrete properties.</description>

      <description>Last week I did a couple of talks about modelling with Neo4j meet ups in Amsterdam and Antwerp and there were a few questions about how indexing works with labels that are being introduced in Neo4j 2.0
As well as defining properties on nodes we can also assign them a label which can be used to categorise different groups of nodes.
For example in the football graph we might choose to tag player nodes with the label &#39;Player&#39;:</description>

I&#39;d previously used ImpermanentGraphDatabase when using Neo4j embedded and Ian pointed me towards CommunityServerBuilder which allows us to do a similar thing in Neo4j server world.
I&#39;ve created an example of a dummy unmanaged extension and test showing this approach but it&#39;s reasonably simple.</description>

These would typically be accessed by using jConsole or similar but some monitoring tools aren&#39;t able to use the JMX hook and a HTTP interface would work better.
Luckily Neo4j server does expose the JMX beans and we can get a list of URIs to query by hitting the following URI:</description>

      <description>One of the things that I&#39;ve found difficult when looking at a new Neo4j database is working out the structure of the data it contains.
I&#39;m used to relational databases where you can easily get a list of the table and the foreign keys that allow you to join them to each other.

      <title>neo4j: Setting query timeout</title>

      <description>Updated December 2015  When I initially wrote this post in 2013 this was an experimental feature that worked using the Neo4j 1.9 series but no longer does in more recent Neo4j versions (2.2, 2.3). The terminating a running transaction page in the docs describes the supported way of terminating queries. - - - - - - - - - - -
When I was first learning cypher, neo4j&#39;s query language, I frequently wrote queries which traversed the whole graph multiple times and &#39;hung&#39; for hours as they were evaluated.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been doing some work which involves reading in CSV files, for which I&#39;ve been using OpenCSV, and my initial approach was to read through the file line by line, parse the contents and save it into a list of maps.
This works when the contents of the file fit into memory but is problematic for larger files where I needed to stream the file and process each line individually rather than all of them after the file was loaded.</description>

      <description>I was looking back over some of the queries I wrote for my football data set and I came across one I&#39;d written to work out how many goals players scored in matches that were televised.
The data model looks like this:
 My initial query to work out the top 10 scorers in televised games was as follows:
MATCH (player:Player) WITH player MATCH player-[:played|subbed_on]-&amp;gt;stats-[:in]-&amp;gt;game-[t?:on_tv]-&amp;gt;channel WITH COLLECT({goals: stats.goals, type: TYPE(t)}) AS games, player RETURN player.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with the most recent Neo4j 2.0 milestone release - 2.0.0-M05 - and one of the first things I did was translate the queries from my football data set which were written against Neo4j 1.9.
The following query calculates the number of goals scored by players in matches that were shown on television, not on television and in total.
START player=node:players(&#39;name:*&#39;) MATCH player-[:played|subbed_on]-&amp;gt;stats-[:in]-&amp;gt;game-[t?:on_tv]-&amp;gt;channel WITH COLLECT([stats.goals, TYPE(t)]) AS games, player RETURN player.</description>

      <description>I first came across William Zinsser&#39;s &#39;On Writing Well&#39; about a year ago, but put it down having flicked through a couple of the chapters that I felt were relevant.
It came back onto my radar a month ago and this time I decided to read it cover to cover as I was sure there were some insights that I&#39;d missed due to my haphazard approach the first time around.</description>

      <description>I was looking back over some cypher queries I&#39;d written earlier in the year against my football data set to find some examples of where list comprehensions could be useful and I came across this query which is used to work out which teams were the most badly behaved in terms of accumulating red and yellow cards:
START team = node:teams(&#39;name:*&#39;) MATCH team&amp;lt;-[:for]-like_this&amp;lt;-[:started|as_sub]-player-[r?:sent_off_in|booked_in]-&amp;gt;game&amp;lt;-[:in]-like_this WITH team, COLLECT(r) AS cards WITH team, FILTER(x IN cards: TYPE(x) = &amp;quot;sent_off_in&amp;quot;) AS reds, FILTER(x IN cards: TYPE(x) = &amp;quot;booked_in&amp;quot;) AS yellows RETURN team.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I wrote about ranking Champions League teams using the Elo Rating algorithm, and since I wrote that post I&#39;ve collated data for 10 years worth of matches so I thought an update was in order.
After extracting the details of all those matches I saved them to a JSON file so that I wouldn&#39;t have to parse the HTML pages every time I tweaked the algorithm. This should also make it easier for other people to play with the data.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in an earlier post I&#39;ve been transforming Clojure hash&#39;s into JSON strings using data.json but ran into trouble while trying to parse a hash which contained a Joda Time DateTime instance.
The date in question was constructed like this:
(ns json-date-example (:require [clj-time.format :as f]) (:require [clojure.data.json :as json])) (defn as-date [date-field] (f/parse (f/formatter &amp;quot;dd MMM YYYY&amp;quot;) date-field )) (def my-date (as-date &amp;quot;18 Mar 2012&amp;quot;))  And when I tried to convert a hash containing that object into a string I got the following exception:</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I described how I&#39;d scraped football matches using Clojure&#39;s Enlive, and the next step after translating the HTML representation into a Clojure map was to save it as a JSON document.
I decided to follow a two step process to achieve this:
 Convert hash to JSON string Write JSON string to file  I imagine there&#39;s probably a way to convert the hash to a stream and pipe that into a file but my JSON document isn&#39;t very large so I think this way is ok for now.</description>

      <description>In the time I&#39;ve spent playing around with Clojure one thing I&#39;ve always got confused by is the error message you get when trying to return a vector using the anonymous function shorthand.
For example, if we want function which creates a vector with the values 1, 2, and the argument passed into the function we could write the following:
&amp;gt; ((fn [x] [1 2 x]) 6) [1 2 6]  However, when I tried to convert it to the shorthand &#39;#()&#39; syntax I got the following exception:</description>

      <description>Ever since I started using the Emacs + nrepl combination to play around with Clojure I&#39;ve been getting fairly non descript error messages whenever I pass the wrong parameters to a function.
For example if I try to update a non existent key in a form I get a Null Pointer Exception:
&amp;gt; (update-in {} [:mark] inc) NullPointerException clojure.lang.Numbers.ops (Numbers.java:942)  In this case it&#39;s clear that the hash doesn&#39;t have a key &#39;:mark&#39; so the function blows up.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with Clojure using Emacs and nrepl recently and my normal work flow is to write some code in Emacs and then have it evaluated in nrepl by typing Ctrl X + Ctrl E at the end of the function.
I tried this once recently and got the following exception instead of a successful evaluation:
FileNotFoundException Could not locate ranking_algorithms/ranking__init.class or ranking_algorithms/ranking.clj on classpath: clojure.lang.RT.load (RT.java:432)  I was a bit surprised because I had nrepl running already (via (Meta + X) + Enter + nrepl-jack-in) and I&#39;d only ever seen that exception refer to dependencies which weren&#39;t in my project.</description>

      <description>When putting together data sets to play around with, one of the more boring tasks is stripping out characters that you&#39;re not interested in and more often than not those characters are white spaces.
Since I&#39;ve been building data sets using Clojure I wanted to write a function that would do this for me.
I started out with the following string:
(def word &amp;quot; with a little bit of space we can make it through the night &amp;quot;)  which I wanted to format in such a way that there would be a maximum of one space between each word.</description>

(def teams #{ &amp;quot;Man Utd&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Man City&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Arsenal&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Chelsea&amp;quot;})  and I wanted to transform that into a map from the team to their ranking e.g.
Man Utd -&amp;gt; {:points 1200} Man City -&amp;gt; {:points 1200} Arsenal -&amp;gt; {:points 1200} Chelsea -&amp;gt; {:points 1200}  I had read the documentation of array-map, a function which can be used to transform a collection of pairs into a map, and it seemed like it might do the trick.</description>

A simple reduce which adds together the numbers 1-10 would look like this:
&amp;gt; (reduce + 0 (range 1 11)) 55  If we want to see the intermediate values of this function called then instead of using reduce there&#39;s a function called reductions which gives us exactly what we want:</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with Clojure maps recently and I wanted to merge two maps of rankings where the rankings in the second map overrode those in the first while only keeping the teams from the first map.
The merge function overrides keys in earlier maps but also adds keys that only appear in later maps. For example, if we merge the following maps:
&amp;gt; (merge {&amp;quot;Man. United&amp;quot; 1500 &amp;quot;Man. City&amp;quot; 1400} {&amp;quot;Man.</description>

(def teams { &amp;quot;Man. United&amp;quot; {:points 1500 :rd 350} &amp;quot;Man. City&amp;quot; {:points 1450 :rd 300} })  We might want to increase Man. United&#39;s points score by one for which we could use the update-in function:</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I wrote about the Elo Rating system and when reading more about it I learnt that one of its weaknesses is that it doesn&#39;t take into account the reliability of a players&#39; rating.
For example, a player may not have played for a long time. When they next play a match we shouldn&#39;t assume that the accuracy of that rating is the same as for another player with the same rating but who plays regularly.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in an earlier blog post I&#39;ve been learning about ranking systems and one of the first ones I came across was the Elo rating system which is most famously used to rank chess players.
The Elo rating system uses the following formula to work out a player/team&#39;s ranking after they&#39;ve participated in a match:
 R&#39; = R + K * (S - E)  R&#39; is the new rating R is the old rating K is a maximum value for increase or decrease of rating (16 or 32 for ELO) S is the score for a game E is the expected score for a game  I converted that formula into the following Clojure functions:</description>

The format was changed as well - the evening consisted of ~10 lightening talks which were spread out over about 3 hours, an approach Rik has used at similar events in Belgium and Holland earlier in the year.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a previous blog post, I&#39;ve been learning about ranking algorithms and I wanted to apply them to a series of football matches to see who the strongest team was.
Before that, however, I wanted to sketch out the functions that I&#39;d need to do this and I started with the following collections of matches and team rankings:
(def m [{:home &amp;quot;Manchester United&amp;quot;, :away &amp;quot;Manchester City&amp;quot;, :home_score 1, :away_score 0} {:home &amp;quot;Manchester United&amp;quot;, :away &amp;quot;Manchester City&amp;quot;, :home_score 2, :away_score 0}]) (def teams [ {:name &amp;quot;Manchester United&amp;quot; :points 1200} {:name &amp;quot;Manchester City&amp;quot; :points 1200} ])  I wanted to iterate over the matches and make the appropriate updates to the teams&#39; rankings depending on the result of the match.</description>

I wanted to get a list of all the matches for a specific season so I started out by downloading the file:

      <description>I often go off on massive tangents reading all about a new topic but don&#39;t record what I&#39;ve read so if I go back to the topic again in the future I have to start from scratch which is quite frustrating.
In this instance after playing around with calculating the eigenvector centrality of a sub graph I learnt that this algorithm can also be used in ranking systems.
I started off by reading a paper written by James Keener about the Perron-Frobenius Theorem and the ranking of American football teams.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with the Unix tar command a bit this week and realised that I&#39;d memorised some of the flag combinations but didn&#39;t actually know what each of them meant.
For example, one of the most common things that I want to do is extract a gripped neo4j archive:
$ wget http://dist.neo4j.org/neo4j-community-1.9.2-unix.tar.gz $ tar -xvf neo4j-community-1.9.2-unix.tar.gz  where:

      <description>One of the common feature requests on the ThoughtWorks projects that I worked on was that the application we were working on should be almost infinitely configurable to cover potential future use cases.
My experience of attempting to do this was that you ended up with an extremely complicated code base and those future use cases often didn&#39;t come to fruition.
It therefore made more sense to solve the problem at hand and then make the code more configurable if/when the need arose.</description>

 Once more: we are not modelling reality, but the way information about reality is processed, by people.  It reminds me of similar advice in Eric Evans&#39; Domain Driven Design and it&#39;s advice which I believe is helpful when designing a model in a graph database.</description>

Only after I&#39;d done that would I start planning how I could make my changes.
This works reasonably well but it&#39;s quite time consuming and a couple of years ago a former colleague (I can&#39;t remember who!</description>

InetAddress.getByName( &amp;quot;host.that.is.invalid&amp;quot; )  I was getting back a valid although unreachable host. When I called ping it was easier to see what was going on:
$ ping host.that.is.invalid PING host.that.is.invalid (92.242.132.15): 56 data bytes Request timeout for icmp_seq 0 Request timeout for icmp_seq 1 Request timeout for icmp_seq 2  As you can see, that hostname is resolving to &#39;92.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been working through Coursera&#39;s Linear Algebra course and since all of the exercises are in Python I&#39;ve been playing around with it again.
One interesting thing I learnt is that you can construct dictionaries using a list comprehension type syntax.
For example, if we start with the following dictionaries:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = { &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;: 1, &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;:2 } &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; y = {1: &amp;quot;mark&amp;quot;, 2: &amp;quot;will&amp;quot;} &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x {&#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2} &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; y {1: &#39;mark&#39;, 2: &#39;will&#39;}  We might want to create a new dictionary which links from the keys in x to the values in y.</description>

      <description>Earlier in the week I wrote a blog post showing how to calculate the eigenvector centrality of an adjacency matrix using JBLAS and the next step was to work out the eigenvector centrality of a neo4j sub graph.
There were 3 steps involved in doing this:
 Export the neo4j sub graph as an adjacency matrix Run JBLAS over it to get eigenvector centrality scores for each node Write those scores back into neo4j  I decided to make use of the Paul Revere data set from Kieran Healy&#39;s blog post which consists of people and groups that they had membership of.</description>

I created the EBS volume through the AWS console and one thing that initially caught me out is that the EC2 instance and EBS volume need to be in the same region and zone.
Therefore if I create my EC2 instance in &#39;eu-west-1b&#39; then I need to create my EBS volume in &#39;eu-west-1b&#39; as well otherwise I won&#39;t be able to attach it to that instance.</description>

      <description>One of the things I remember being taught while growing up is that in an interaction where somebody is something to someone else it&#39;s their responsibility to do so in a way that the receiver can understand.
Even if you think you&#39;ve done a good job of explaining something, the receiver of the communication decides whether or not that&#39;s the case.
I&#39;d always assumed that this advice made most sense in the context of a one to one conversation but recently I&#39;ve realised that it also makes sense when thinking about product documentation.</description>

      <description>Last week I wrote about the betweenness centrality algorithm and my attempts to understand it using graphstream and while reading the source I realised that I might be able to put something together using neo4j&#39;s all shortest paths algorithm.
To recap, the betweenness centrality algorithm is used to determine the load and importance of a node in a graph.
While talking about this with Jen she pointed out that calculating the betweenness centrality of nodes across the whole graph often doesn&#39;t make sense.</description>

      <description>For as long as I&#39;ve been using neo4j&#39;s cypher query language Michael has been telling me to use parameters in my queries but the performance of the queries was always acceptable so I didn&#39;t feel the need.
However, recently I was playing around with a data set and I created ~500 nodes using code similar to this:
require &#39;open-uri&#39; open(&amp;quot;data/people.cyp&amp;quot;, &#39;w&#39;) { |f| (1..500).each do |value| f.puts(&amp;quot;CREATE (p:Person{name: \&amp;quot;#{value}\&amp;quot;})&amp;quot;) end }  That creates a file of cypher statements that look like this:</description>

      <description>Until I started working on the uSwitch energy website around 8 months ago I had not really done any support of a production system so I learnt some interesting lessons in my time there.
Look at the new code first We had our application wired up to Airbrake so whenever a user did anything which resulted in an exception being thrown we received a report with the stack trace, environment variables and which page they were on.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with Jersey over the past couple of days and one thing I wanted to do was create an entry point or index which listed all my resources, the available paths and the verbs they accepted.
Guido Simone explained a neat way of finding the paths and verbs for a specific resource using Jersey&#39;s IntrospectionModeller:
AbstractResource resource = IntrospectionModeller.createResource(JacksonResource.class); System.out.println(&amp;quot;Path is &amp;quot; + resource.getPath().getValue()); String uriPrefix = resource.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been reacquainted with my good friend Jersey over the last couple of days and in getting up and running was reminded that things which seemed easy at the time aren&#39;t as easy when starting from scratch.
I eventually settled on using Sunny Gleason&#39;s j4-minimal repository which wires up Jersey with Jackson, Guice and Jetty which seemed like a good place to start.
I prefer building up JSON objects explicitly rather than setting up automatic mapping so the first thing I did was change the JacksonResource to have an end point that returned a manually built up JSON object:</description>

      <description>Since I now spend most of my time surrounded by graphs I thought it&#39;d be interesting to learn a bit more about graph processing, a topic my colleague Jim wrote about a couple of years ago.
I like to think of the types of queries you&#39;d do with a graph processing engine as being similar in style graph global queries where you take most of the nodes in a graph into account and do some sort of calculation.</description>

      <description>I previously wrote a blog post describing how I&#39;ve been trying to learn more about network sockets in which I created some server sockets and connected to them using netcat.
The next step was to do the same thing in Java and I started out by writing a server socket which echoed any messages sent by the client:
public class EchoServer { public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { int port = 4444; ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port, 50, InetAddress.</description>

In particular I&#39;d not considered what binding a socket to different network interfaces meant so I decided to setup a few examples using netcat to help me understand better.
To start with let&#39;s list the network interfaces that I have on my machine using ifconfig:</description>

I&#39;ve spent a bit of time refactoring the readme which I&#39;d done on a branch of my fork of the repository and consisted of 46 commits, most changing 2 or 3 lines.
I wanted to send Michael a pull request on Github but first I needed to squash all my commits down into a single one.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote a blog post describing how we created a streamed response and the next thing we wanted to do was gzip the response to shrink it&#39;s size a bit.
A bit of searching led to GZIPContentEncodingFilter popping up a lot of times but this is actually needed for a client processing a gripped response rather than helping us to gzip a response from the server.
I noticed that there was a question about this on the mailing list from about a year ago although Michael pointed out that the repository has now moved and the example is available here instead.</description>

I particularly liked the story describing how Abraham Wald helped the US military overcome an instance of this error when trying to work out where to place armour on their bomber planes:</description>

I had the following cypher query to return the football stadiums near Westminster along with their lat/long values:
lat, long, distance = [&amp;quot;51.55786291569685&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;0.144195556640625&amp;quot;, 10] query = &amp;quot; START node = node:geom(&#39;withinDistance:[#{lat}, #{long}, #{distance}]&#39;)&amp;quot; query &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot; RETURN node.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been working on creating a UI to make searching for the football stadiums that I wrote about last week a bit easier and I thought I&#39;d give Leaflet JS a try.
Leaflet is a Javascript library which was recommended to me by Jason Neylon) and can be used as a wrapper around Open Street Map.
I started by creating a simple form where you could fill in a lat/long and distance and it would centre the map on that lat/long and show you a list of the stadiums within that diameter next to the map.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with setting up a neo4j cluster using Vagrant and HAProxy and one thing I wanted to do was define two different roles for the HAProxy and neo4j machines.
When I was working at uSwitch Nathan had solved a similar problem, but with AWS VMs, by defining the role in an environment variable in the VM&#39;s spin up script.
In retrospect I think I might have been able to do that by using the shell provisioner and calling that before the puppet provisioner but Nathan, Gareth Rushgrove and Gregor Russbuelt suggested that using facter might be better.</description>

      <description>A couple of years ago I wrote a blog post explaining how I&#39;d used GNU awk to extract story numbers from git commit messages and I wanted to do a similar thing today to extract some node ids from a file.
My eventual solution looked like this:
$ echo &amp;quot;mark #1000&amp;quot; | gawk &#39;{ match($0, /#([0-9]+)/, arr); if(arr[1] != &amp;quot;&amp;quot;) print arr[1] }&#39; 1000  But in the comments an alternative approach was suggested which used the Mac version of awk and the RSTART and RLENGTH global variables which get set when a match is found:</description>

      <description>Late last week my colleague Peter wrote up some documentation about creating spatial indexes in neo4j via HTTP, something I hadn&#39;t realised was possible until then.
I previously wrote about indexing football stadiums using neo4j spatial but the annoying thing about the approach I described was that I was using neo4j in embedded mode which restricts you to using a JVM language.
The rest of my code is in Ruby so I thought I&#39;d translate that code.</description>

      <description>Michael recently pointed me to the neo4j JDBC driver which he and Rickard have written so I thought I&#39;d try and port the code from my previous post to use that instead of the console.
To start with I added the following dependencies to my POM file:
&amp;lt;dependencies&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.neo4j&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;neo4j-jdbc&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;1.9&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dependencies&amp;gt; &amp;lt;repositories&amp;gt; &amp;lt;repository&amp;gt; &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;neo4j-maven&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt; &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;neo4j maven&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt; &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;http://m2.neo4j.org&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/repository&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/repositories&amp;gt;  I then tried to create a connection to a local neo4j server instance that I had running on port 7474:</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve written before about using the cypher CREATE statement to add inferred information to a neo4j graph and sometimes we want to do that but have to deal with optional properties while creating our new relationships.
For example let&#39;s say we have the following people in our graph with the &#39;started&#39; and &#39;left&#39; properties representing their tenure at a company:
CREATE (person1 { personId: 1, started: 1361708546 }) CREATE (person2 { personId: 2, started: 1361708546, left: 1371708646 }) CREATE (company { companyId: 1 })  We want to create a &#39;TENURE&#39; link from them to the company including the &#39;started&#39; and &#39;left&#39; properties when applicable and might start with the following query:</description>

      <description>When people first use neo4j they frequently start out by embedding it in a Java application but eventually they want to explore the graph in a more visual way.
One simple way to do this is to start neo4j in server mode and use the web console.
Our initial code might read like this:
public class GraphMeUp { public static void main(String[] args) { GraphDatabaseService graphDb = new EmbeddedGraphDatabase(&amp;quot;/path/to/data/graph.db&amp;quot;); } }  or:</description>

      <description>The neo4j docs have a few examples explaining how to to write cypher queries dealing with path ranges but an interesting variation that I came across recently is where we want to find the individual hops in a path.
I thought the managers that Chelsea have had since Roman Abramovich took over would serve as a useful data set to show how this works.
So we create all the managers and a &#39;SUCCEEDED_BY&#39; relationship between them as follows:</description>

      <description>As long as I&#39;ve been using a Mac I always understood that if you needed to set $JAVA_HOME for any program, it should be set to /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK.
On my machine this points to the 1.6 JDK:
$ ls -alh /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK -&amp;gt; /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents  This was a bit surprising to me since I&#39;ve actually got Java 7 installed on the machine as well so I&#39;d assumed the symlink would have been changed:</description>

      <description>neo4j uses Lucene to handle indexing of nodes and relationships in the graph but something that can be a bit confusing at first is how to handle special characters in Lucene queries.
For example let&#39;s say we set up a database with the following data:
CREATE ({name: &amp;quot;-one&amp;quot;}) CREATE ({name: &amp;quot;-two&amp;quot;}) CREATE ({name: &amp;quot;-three&amp;quot;}) CREATE ({name: &amp;quot;four&amp;quot;})  And for whatever reason we only wanted to return the nodes that begin with a hyphen.</description>

      <description>Andres and I recently found ourselves wanting to delete a remote branch which had the same name as a tag and therefore the normal way of doing that wasn&#39;t worked out as well as we&#39;d hoped.
I created a dummy repository to recreate the state we&#39;d got ourselves into:
$ echo &amp;quot;mark&amp;quot; &amp;gt; README $ git commit -am &amp;quot;readme&amp;quot; $ echo &amp;quot;for the branch&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; README $ git commit -am &amp;quot;for the branch&amp;quot; $ git checkout -b same Switched to a new branch &#39;same&#39; $ git push origin same Counting objects: 5, done.</description>

      <description>neo4.rb is a JRuby gem that allows you to create an embedded neo4j database and last week I was working out how to setup a neo4j 1.8.2 HA cluster using the gem.
There is an example showing how to create a HA cluster using neo4j.rb so I thought I could adapt that to do what I wanted.
I had the following Gemfile:

 The date modelling is based on an approach I first came across in a shutl presentation and is described in more detail in the docs. I created a dummy data set with some made up appointments and dismissals and then tried to write a query to show me who was the manager for a team on a specific date.</description>

      <description>In my continued reading of Daniel Kahneman&#39;s Thinking Fast and Slow I&#39;ve reached the section which talks about the affect heuristic which seems particularly applicable to the technical decisions that we make.
The dominance of conclusions over arguments is most pronounced where emotions are involved. The psychologist Paul Slovic has proposed an affect heuristic in which people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world. The way I&#39;ve seen this heuristic coming into play in the software world is when we do an &#39;objective&#39; overview of the technical tools/options that we could use to solve a particular problem.</description>

      <description>On the recommendation of Mike Jones I&#39;ve been reading through Daniel Kahneman&#39;s Thinking Fast and Slow in which the first part of the book covers our two styles of thinking:
 System 1 - operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System 2 - allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.</description>

require &#39;neography&#39; neo = Neography::Rest.new neo.execute_query(&amp;quot;create (me {name: &#39;Mark&#39;})&amp;quot;) query = &amp;quot; START n=node:node_auto_index(name={name})&amp;quot; query &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot; FOREACH (friend in {friends} : CREATE f=friend, n-[:FRIEND]-&amp;gt;f)&amp;quot; neo.execute_query(query, {&amp;quot;name&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Mark&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; [{ &amp;quot;name&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Will&amp;quot;}, {&amp;quot;name&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Paul&amp;quot;}]})  To check that the &#39;FRIEND&#39; relationships have been created we&#39;d write the following query:</description>

I&#39;m not sure whether this is because I don&#39;t have anything really appealing on the list of things to work on or whether having so many things listed (I have 8-10 items) is causing the paralysis.</description>

      <description>One of the first things that we did before starting any of the A/B tests that I&#39;ve previously written about was to work out how many users we needed to go through before we could be sure that the results we saw were statistically significant.
We used the prop.test function from R to do this and based on our traffic at the time worked out that we&#39;d need to run a test for 6 weeks to achieve statistical significance.</description>

      <description>Over the past few years I&#39;ve seen the emergence of polyglot persistence i.e. using different data storage technologies for different data and in most situations we work that out up front.
 For example we might use MongoDB to store data about a customer journey through our website but we might simultaneously write page view data through to something like Hadoop or Redshift:
This works reasonably well but sometimes it might not be immediately obvious how we want to query our data when we first start collecting it and our storage choice might not be the best for writing these queries.</description>

      <description>I was chatting with Brian Blignaut last week after the Equal Experts NoSQL event and he made an interesting observation that in this age of Polyglot Persistence we often rule out the relational database.
I think it&#39;s definitely better that we now have many different options for where we store our data - be it as key/value pairs, documents or as a network/graph.
Having these options forces us to think more about how we&#39;re going to read/write data in our application whereas previously our effort was focused around which tables we were going to pull out.</description>

Jim gives quite a neat summary of the difference between the two on the thread:
 Properties are the data that an entity like a node [or relationship] holds. Relationships simply form the semantic glue (type, direction, cardinality) between nodes.</description>

      <description>I was recently reading an article written by Henry Winter where he mentioned some of the ideas that Sir ALex Ferguson has been covering in some interviews he&#39;s been doing at Harvard and one bit stood out for me:  In a series of interviews in Harvard, Ferguson debated dealing with “fragile” egos in the dressing room, the power of the two simple words “well done” in motivating individuals and the importance of criticising players’ mistakes immediately after the match and then moving on.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my previous blog post I&#39;ve been hacking on a product taxonomy and I wanted to create a &#39;CHILD&#39; relationship between a collection of categories.
For example, I had the following array and I wanted to transform it into an array of &#39;SubCategory, Category&#39; pairs:
taxonomy = [&amp;quot;Cat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;SubCat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;SubSubCat&amp;quot;] # I wanted this to become [(&amp;quot;Cat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;SubCat&amp;quot;), (&amp;quot;SubCat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;SubSubCat&amp;quot;)  In order to do this we need to zip the first 2 items with the last which I found reasonably easy to do using Python:</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with modelling a product taxonomy and one thing that I wanted to do was find out the full path where a product sits under the tree.
I created a simple data set to show the problem:
CREATE (cat { name: &amp;quot;Cat&amp;quot; }) CREATE (subcat1 { name: &amp;quot;SubCat1&amp;quot; }) CREATE (subcat2 { name: &amp;quot;SubCat2&amp;quot; }) CREATE (subsubcat1 { name: &amp;quot;SubSubCat1&amp;quot; }) CREATE (product1 { name: &amp;quot;Product1&amp;quot; }) CREATE (cat)-[:CHILD]-subcat1-[:CHILD]-subsubcat1 CREATE (product1)-[:HAS_CATEGORY]-(subsubcat1)  I wanted to write a query which would return &#39;product1&#39; and the tree &#39;Cat - SubCat1 - SubSubCat1&#39; and initially wrote the following query:</description>

      <description>Chris and I were looking at the neo4j log files of a client earlier in the week and wanted to do some processing of the file so we could ask the client to send us some further information.
The log file was over 10,000 lines long but the bit of the file we were interesting in was only a few hundred lines.
I usually use Vim and the &#39;:set number&#39; when I want to refer to line numbers in a file but Chris showed me that we can achieve the same thing with e.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve written a couple of posts over the last few months about my experiences with A/B testing and one conversation we often used to have was around user experience vs conversion rate.
Once you start running an A/B test it encourages you to focus more on the conversion rate of users in different parts of the flow and your inclination is to make changes that increase that conversion rate.
Another one of our drivers is to provide the best user experience that we can to our customers and since sometimes this means that the best thing for them is not to switch it seems that these two must be in conflict.</description>

I noticed a similar thing today when Rickard and I were having a look at why a Lucene index query wasn&#39;t behaving as we expected.
I setup some data in a neo4j database using neography with the following code:</description>

      <description>Nate Silver is famous for having correctly predicted the winner of all 50 states in the 2012 United States elections and Sid recommended his book so I could learn more about statistics for the A/B tests that we were running.
I thought the book was a really good introduction to applied statistics and by using real life examples which most people would be able to relate to it makes a potentially dull subject interesting.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been using Sublime a bit recently and one thing I wanted to do was put neo4j cypher queries into files with arbitrary extensions and have them recognised as cypher files every time I open them.
I&#39;m using the cypher Sublime plugin to get the syntax highlighting but since I&#39;ve got my cypher in a .haml file it only remembers that it should have cypher highlighting as long as the file is open.</description>

      <description>Thibaut and I spent the best part of the last couple of days trying to diagnose a problem we were having trying to make a POST request using rest-client to one of our services.
We have nginx fronting the application server so the request passes through there first:
 The problem we were having was that the request was timing out on the client side before it had been processed and the request wasn&#39;t reaching the application server.</description>

Alfred Alfred is a Quick Silver replacement which allows you to quickly open applications, find files, search Google and more. Even though we&#39;re not using half of its features it&#39;s still proved to be useful.</description>

      <description>A few agos I wrote a post about treating servers as cattle, not as pets in which I described an approach to managing virtual machines at uSwitch whereby we frequently spin up new ones and delete the existing ones.
I&#39;ve worked on teams previously where we&#39;ve also talked about this mentality but ended up not doing it because it was difficult, usually for one of two reasons:
 Slow spin up - this might be due to the cloud providers infrastructure, doing too much on spin up or I&#39;m sure a variety of other reasons.</description>

      <description>Over the last year or so I&#39;ve spent quite a bit of time working with puppet and one of the things that we had to decide when installing packages was whether or not to specify a particular version.
On the first project I worked on we didn&#39;t bother and just let the package manager chose the most recent version.
Therefore if we were installing nginx the puppet code would read like this:</description>

      <description>Tim and I were investigating a weird problem we were having with nginx where it was getting in a state where it had exceeded the number of open files allowed on the system and started rejecting requests.
We can find out the maximum number of open files that we&#39;re allowed on a system with the following command:
$ ulimit -n 1024  Our hypothesis was that some socket connections were never being closed and therefore the number of open files was climbing slowly upwards until it exceeded the limit.</description>

$ free -m total used free shared buffers cached Mem: 365 360 5 0 59 97 -/+ buffers/cache: 203 161 Swap: 767 13 754  I wanted to find out what % of the memory on the machine was being used and as I understand it the numbers that we would use to calculate this are the &#39;total&#39; value on the &#39;Mem&#39; line and the &#39;used&#39; value on the &#39;buffers/cache&#39; line.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with some code to spin up AWS instances using Fabric and Boto and one thing that I wanted to do was define a bunch of default properties in a JSON file and then load this into a script.
I found it harder to work out how to do this than I expected to so I thought I&#39;d document it for future me!
My JSON file looks like this:</description>

      <description>Although I didn&#39;t go to Dev Ops Days London earlier in the year I was following the hash tag on twitter and one of my favourites things that I read was the following:
 “Treating servers as cattle, not as pets” #DevOpsDays  I think this is particularly applicable now that a lot of the time we&#39;re using virtualised production environments via AWS, Rackspace or .
At uSwitch we use AWS and over the last week Sid and I spent some time investigating a memory leak by running our applications against two different versions of Ruby.</description>

      <description>After coming across this post about why you should use Sublime Text I decided to try using it a bit more and one of the things that I missed from Textmate was the way you can select the current file on the sidebar.
In Textmate the shortcut to do that is &#39;Cmd + Ctrl + R&#39; so I wanted to be able to do something similar or configure Sublime so it responded to the same shortcut.</description>

      <description>I part time administrate a football forum that I used to run when I was at university and one problem we had recently was that some of the tables/indices had got corrupted when MySQL crashed due to a lack of disc space.

      <description>Despite the fact that I&#39;ve been working full time in software for almost 8 years now every now and then I still need a reminder of how useful reading logs can be in helping solve problems.
I had a couple of such instances recently which I thought I&#39;d document.
The first was a couple of weeks ago when Tim and I were pairing on moving some applications from Passenger to Unicorn and were testing whether or not we&#39;d done so successfully.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve done a bit of modelling with years and months in neo4j graphs that I&#39;ve worked on previously but I haven&#39;t ever done anything with time so I thought it&#39;d be interesting to have a go with my football graph.
I came across this StackOverflow post on my travels which suggested that indexing nodes by time would be helpful and since I have a bunch of football matches with associated times I thought I&#39;d try it out.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago Tim and I were spinning up a new service on a machine which wasn&#39;t quite working so we were manually making changes to the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file and restarting nginx to try and sort it out.
This process is generally not that interesting - you open the file in vi, make some changes, close it, then restart nginx and see if it works. If not then you open the file again and repeat.</description>

      <description>Last week Jason and I with (a lot of) help from Tim have been working on moving several of our applications from Passenger to Unicorn and decided that the easiest way to do this was to create a new set of nodes with this setup.
The architecture we&#39;re working with looks like this at a VM level:
 The &#39;nginx LB&#39; nodes are responsible for routing all the requests to their appropriate application servers and the &#39;web&#39; nodes serve the different applications initially using Passenger.</description>

In this context he&#39;s referring to javascript libraries but I think his thinking is generally applicable.
Having worked for a few years now I&#39;ve played around with a reasonable number of programming languages/text editors/databases/etc to the point that I have favourites when it comes to solving certain problems.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my previous post I wanted to add televised games to my football graph and the Premier League website seemed like the best case to find out which games those were.
I initially tried to use Nokogiri to grab the data that I wanted...
&amp;gt; require &#39;nokogiri&#39; &amp;gt; require &#39;open-air&#39; &amp;gt; tv_times = Nokogiri::HTML(open(&#39;http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/matchday/broadcast-schedules.tv.html?rangeType=.dateSeason&amp;amp;country=GB&amp;amp;clubId=ALL&amp;amp;season=2012-2013&amp;amp;isLive=true&#39;))  ...but when I tried to query by CSS selector for all the matches nothing came back:</description>

      <description>The latest thing that I added to my football graph was the matches that are shown on TV as I have the belief that players who score on televised games get more attention than players who score in other games.
I thought it&#39;d be interesting to work out who the top scorers are on each of these game types.
I added the following relationship type to allow me to do this:</description>

      <description>Jason and I were setting up an internal static website using an S3 bucket a couple of days ago and wanted to point a more friendly domain name at it.
We initially called our bucket &#39;static-site&#39; and then created a CNAME entry using zerigo to point our sub domain at the bucket.
The mapping was something like this:

      <description>As I mentioned in my last post I&#39;m trying to get the hang of the WITH statement in neo4j&#39;s cypher query language and I found another application when trying to work out which opponents teams played on certain days.
I started out with a query which grouped the data set by day and showed the opponents that were played on that day:
START team = node:teams(&#39;name:&amp;quot;Manchester United&amp;quot;&#39;) MATCH team-[h:home_team|away_team]-game-[:on_day]-day RETURN DISTINCT day.</description>

I wanted to find out whether Luis Suárez has a better scoring record depending on which day a match is played on.
We start out by finding all the matches that he&#39;s played in and which days those matches were on:</description>

      <description>I recently wrote about some code I&#39;ve been playing with to import neo4j spatial data and while looking to simplify the code I came across the doto macro.
The doto macro allows us to chain method calls on an initial object and then returns the resulting object. e.g.
(doto (new java.util.HashMap) (.put &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; 1) (.put &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; 2)) -&amp;gt; {a=1, b=2}  In our case this comes in quite useful in the function used to create a stadium node which initially reads like this:~~~ ~~~lisp (defn create-stadium-node [db line] (let [stadium-node (.</description>

I thought leiningen would probably work quite well for this as you can point it at a Java class and have it be executed.
To start with I had to change the import code slightly to link stadiums to teams which have already been added to the graph:</description>

Since this particular service only serves HTTP GET requests it was reasonably easy to setup a cURL command to do this:
while true; do curl -k -s -w %{time_total} https://serviceurl/whatever/something; -o /dev/null; printf &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;; done &amp;gt; service.</description>

      <description>One of the things that I wanted to add to my football graph was something location related so I could try out neo4j spatial and I thought the easiest way to do that was to model the location of football stadiums.
To start with I needed to add spatial as an unmanaged extension to my neo4j plugins folder which involved doing the following:
$ git clone git://github.com/neo4j/spatial.git spatial $ cd spatial $ mvn clean package -Dmaven.</description>

      <description>I spent some of the weekend working my way through Jim, Ian &amp; Emil&#39;s book &#39;Graph Databases&#39; and one of the things that they emphasise is that graphs allow us to make relationships first class citizens in our model.
Looking back on a couple of the graphs that I modelled last year I realise that I didn&#39;t quite get this and although the graphs I modelled had some relationships a lot of the time I was defining things as properties on nodes.</description>

I always forget how to do this in Haml so I thought I better write it down so I&#39;ll remember next time!
Let&#39;s say we want to add a success class to a paragraph if the variable correct is true and not have any value if it&#39;s false.</description>

      <title>neo4j: Loading data - REST API vs Batch Import</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago when I first started playing around with my football data set I was loading all the data into neo4j using the REST API via neography which was taking around 4 minutes to load.
The data set consisted of just over 250 matches which translated into 8,000 nodes &amp; 30,000 relationships so it&#39;s very small by all means.
Ashok and I were discussing how that could be quicker and the first thing we tried was to store inserted nodes in an in memory hash map and look them up from there rather than doing an index lookup each time.</description>

      <title>Vertical/Horizontal Slicing</title>

      <description>A few years ago I wrote a bunch of posts exploring my experiences of outside in development eventually coming to the conclusion that it seemed to make sense to drive out functionality from the UI and work back from there.
i.e. we take a vertical slice of functionality and then drive it end to end.
On the team I&#39;m working on there&#39;s been success using an approach where the functionality is still split vertically but we work across a horizontal layer for all the cards before moving onto the next layer.</description>

      <description>In 2011 Jay Fields wrote a blog post in which he suggested that it&#39;s better to build teams in which people have a similar opinion on the way software should be built at a high level rather than having people whose opinions are in conflict.
He referred to this as having &#39;compatible opinions on software&#39; and since I read the post I&#39;ve become much more aware of this myself on the teams that I&#39;ve worked on.</description>

      <description>For the past year every system that I&#39;ve worked on has been designed around a micro services architecture and while there are benefits with this approach there is an inherent complexity in software which has to go somewhere!
I thought it&#39;d be interesting to run through some of the new complexities that I&#39;ve noticed in what may well be an acknowledgement of the difficulty of designing distributed systems.
Interactions between components One of the advantages of having lots of small applications is that each one is conceptually easier to understand and we only need to keep the mental model of how that one application works when we&#39;re working on it.</description>

      <description>Jae and I have spent a reasonable chunk of the past few weeks pairing on code that neither of us are familiar with and at times we&#39;ve found it quite difficult to work out exactly what it&#39;s supposed to be doing.
My default stance in this situation is to assume that the code is probably correct and then try and work out how that&#39;s the case.
After I&#39;d vocalised this a few times, Jae pointed out that we couldn&#39;t be sure that the code worked and it didn&#39;t make sense to start with that as an assumption.</description>

      <description>By my latest count I have around 15 different micro services/applications checked out on my machine which comprise the system that I&#39;m currently working on.
Most of these are Ruby related so it&#39;s easy to figure out how to start up a local copy because it&#39;s either bundle exec rails server if it&#39;s a rails application or bundle exec backup if it&#39;s a sinatra/rack application. The clojure applications follow a similar convention and we use rake to run any offline tasks.</description>

      <description>Anna and I were recently discussing the way that we get things done outside of work and since December I&#39;ve been fairly religiously working through various &#39;to-do&#39; lists with a pomodoro timer.
So far I&#39;ve done 308 30 minute pomodoros in about 8 weeks which is just under 20 hours a week which is not bad but still leaves time for a ridiculous amount of procrastination.
These are some of the things that I&#39;ve noticed from only doing things when it&#39;s explicitly on a timer:</description>

      <description>A reasonable amount of the information that I consume comes either via scanning twitter or from my prismatic feed but I noticed that I&#39;m quite biased to reading things in similar subject areas.
I tend to end up reading about data mining/science, functional programming and startups and while the articles are mostly interesting it does eventually start to feel like you&#39;re in an echo chamber. I have a subscription to the ACM mainly because I enjoy reading the &#39;Communications of the ACM&#39; magazine which gets sent out every month and until recently I only read articles which I thought would be interesting.</description>

      <description>In my continued playing around with football data I wanted to write a cypher query against neo4j which would show me which teams had missed the most penalties this season and who missed them.
I started off with a query that returned all the penalties that have been missed this season and the games those misses happened in:
START player = node:players(&#39;name:*&#39;) MATCH player-[:missed_penalty_in]-game, player-[:played|subbed_on]-stats-[:in]-game, stats-[:for]-team, game-[:home_team]-home, game-[:away_team]-away RETURN player.name, team.</description>

I initially had the following code to do that:
rows.each do |row| next if row.strip.empty? # other scraping code end  Unfortunately that approach broke down fairly quickly because empty rows contained a non breaking space i.</description>

The data model that I&#39;m querying looks like this:
 I started off with the following query which traverses from Arsenal to all the games that they&#39;ve taken part in and finds all the players who&#39;ve played in those games:</description>

      <description>Having worked on a few data related applications over the last ten months or so Ashok and I were recently discussing some of the things that we&#39;ve learnt
One of the things he pointed out is that it&#39;s very helpful to separate the different stages of a data work flow into their own applications/scripts.
I decided to try out this idea with some football data that I&#39;m currently trying to model and I ended up with the following stages:</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a previous post I&#39;ve been playing around with some football related data over the last few days and one query I ran (using cypher) was to find all the players who&#39;ve been sent off this season in the Premiership.
The model in the graph around sending offs looks like this:
 My initial query looked like this:
START player = node:players(&#39;name:*&#39;) MATCH player-[:sent_off_in]-game-[:in_month]-month RETURN player.name, month.name  First we get the names of all the players which are stored in an index and then we follow relationships to the games they were sent off in and then find which months those games were played in.</description>

      <description>Last year I wrote a post describing how I&#39;d gone about getting data for my ThoughtWorks graph and one mistake about my approach in retrospect is that I filtered the data too early.
My workflow looked like this:
 Scrape internal application using web driver and save useful data to JSON files Parse JSON files and load nodes/relationships into neo4j  The problem with the first step is that I was trying to determine up front what data was useful and as a result I ended up running the scrapping application multiple times when I realised I didn&#39;t have all the data I wanted.</description>

Rooney 8′, 27′  My initial regular expression was the following which annoyingly captures the time of the first goal:
&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Rooney 8′, 27′&amp;quot;.match(/(.*)\s\d(.*)/)[1] =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Rooney 8,&amp;quot;  It works fine if the player has only scored one goal…

      <description>Jen and I recently started working on the Kaggle Titanic problem and we thought it&#39;d probably be useful to start with some exploratory data analysis to get a feel for the data set.
For this problem you are given a selection of different features describing the passengers on board the Titanic and you have to predict whether or not they would have survived or died based on those features.
I thought an interesting first thing to look at would be the survival rate for passengers of different socio economic status as you would imagine that people of a higher status were more likely to have survived.</description>

Feature extraction in this context means that we&#39;d generate some other features to train a classifier with rather than relying on just the pixel values we were provided.
Every week Jen would try and persuade me that we should try it out but it wasn&#39;t until I was flicking through the notes from the Columbia Data Science class that it struck home:</description>

The approaches tend to fall into roughly three categories:
Predominantly Manual This tends to be less frequent these days as most developers have at some stage flicked through The Pragmatic Programmer and been persuaded that automating away boring and repetitive tasks is probably a good idea.</description>

      <description>As part of some code I&#39;ve been playing around I wanted to remove an item from a tuple which wasn&#39;t particularly easy because Python&#39;s tuple data structure is immutable.
I therefore needed to create a new tuple excluding the value which I wanted to remove.
I ended up writing the following function to do this but I imagine there might be an easier way because it&#39;s quite verbose:
def tuple_without(original_tuple, element_to_remove): new_tuple = [] for s in list(original_tuple): if not s == element_to_remove: new_tuple.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my previous post I&#39;ve been playing around with numpy and I wanted to get the values of a collection of different indices in a 2D array.
If we had a 2D array that looked like this:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = arange(20).reshape(4,5) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x array([[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14], [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]])  I knew that it was possible to retrieve the first 3 rows by using the following code:</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with numpy this evening in an attempt to improve the performance of a Travelling Salesman Problem implementation and I wanted to get every value in a specific column of a 2D array.
The array looked something like this:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = arange(20).reshape(4,5) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x array([[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14], [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]])  I wanted to get the values for the 2nd column of each row which would return an array containing 1, 6, 11 and 16.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote about an implementation of the Bellman Ford shortest path algorithm and concluded by saying that it took 27 seconds to calculate the shortest path in the graph for any node.
This seemed a bit slow and while browsing the Coursera forums I came across a suggestion that the algorithm would run much more quickly if we used vectorization with numpy rather than nested for loops.
Vectorisation refers to a problem solving approach where we make use of matrices operations which is what numpy allows us to do.</description>

      <description>The latest problem of the Algorithms 2 class required us to write an algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two nodes on a graph and one algorithm which allows us to do this is Bellman-Ford.
Bellman-Ford computes the single source shortest path which means that if we have a 5 vertex graph we&#39;d need to run it 5 times to find the shortest path for each vertex and then find the shortest paths of those shortest paths.</description>

      <description>We wanted to tail one of the log files simultaneously on 12 servers this afternoon to try and see if a particular event was being logged and rather than opening 12 SSH sessions decided to get Fabric to help us out.
My initial attempt to do this was the following:
fab -H host1,host2,host3 -- tail -f /var/www/awesome/current/log/production.log  It works but the problem is that by default Fabric runs the specified command one machine after the other so we&#39;ve actually managed to block Fabric with the tail command on &#39;host1&#39;.</description>

      <description>I recently described two versions of the Knapsack problem written in Ruby and Python and one common thing is that I used a global cache to store the results of previous calculations.
From my experience of coding in Haskell it&#39;s not considered very idiomatic to write code like that and although I haven&#39;t actually tried it, potentially more tricky to achieve.
I thought it&#39;d be interesting to try and write the algorithm in Haskell with that constraint in mind and my first version looked like this:</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve written previously about our attempts at the Kaggle Digit Recogniser problem and our approach so far has been to use the data provided and plug it into different algorithms and see what we end up with.
From browsing through the forums we saw others mentioning feature extraction - an approach where we transform the data into another format , the thinking being that we can train a better classifier with better data.</description>

 The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.</description>

      <description>Something that I&#39;ve noticed when trying to install various different bundles is that the installation instructions which worked flawlessly on Snow Leopard don&#39;t seem to do the job on Mountain Lion.
For example, the Clojure bundle assumes that the installation directory is &#39;~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles&#39; but for some reason the &#39;Bundles&#39; folder doesn&#39;t exist.
We therefore have two choices:
 mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles and then continue as normal Install our bundle into &#39;/Applications/TextMate.</description>

union :: IO (IOArray Int Int) -&amp;gt; Int -&amp;gt; Int -&amp;gt; IO (IOArray Int Int) union arrayContainer x y = do actualArray &amp;lt;- arrayContainer ls &amp;lt;- getAssocs actualArray leader1 &amp;lt;- readArray actualArray x leader2 &amp;lt;- readArray actualArray y let newValues = (map (\(index, value) -&amp;gt; (index, leader1)) .</description>

In our algorithm we&#39;re trying to group together points which are &#39;close&#39; to each other and the data structure is particular useful for doing that.

      <description>Part of one of the most recent problems in the Algorithms 2 course required us to find the &#39;neighbours&#39; of binary values.
In this case a neighbour is described as being any other binary value which has an equivalent value or differs in 1 or 2 bits.
e.g. the neighbours of &#39;10000&#39; would be &#39;00000&#39;, &#39;00001&#39;, &#39;00010&#39;, &#39;00100&#39;, &#39;&#39;01000&#39;, &#39;10001&#39;, &#39;10010&#39;, &#39;10011&#39;, &#39;10100&#39;, &#39;10101&#39;, &#39;10110&#39;, &#39;11000&#39;, &#39;11001&#39;, &#39;11010&#39; and &#39;11100&#39;~~~ I initially treated &#39;10000&#39; as an array of 1s and 0s and wrote a function to recursively come up with the above combinations before it was pointed out to me that it&#39;d be much easier to use bit wise logic instead.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote a blog post showing a way of initialising a Haskell map and towards the end of the post I realised how convoluted my approach was and wondered if there was an easier way and indeed there is!
To recap, this is the code I ended up with to populate a map with binary based values as the keys and node ids as the values:
import Data.Map toMap :: [Int] -&amp;gt; Map Int [Int] toMap nodes = fromList $ map asMapEntry $ (groupIgnoringIndex .</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been converting a variation of Kruskal&#39;s algorithm from Ruby into Haskell and one thing I needed to do was create a map of binary based values to node ids.
In Ruby I wrote the following code to do this:
nodes = [1,2,5,7,2,4] @magical_hash = {} nodes.each_with_index do |node, index| @magical_hash[node] ||= [] @magical_hash[node] &amp;lt;&amp;lt; index end =&amp;gt; {1=&amp;gt;[0], 2=&amp;gt;[1, 4], 5=&amp;gt;[2], 7=&amp;gt;[3], 4=&amp;gt;[5]}  From looking at the documentation it seemed like the easiest way to do this in Haskell would be to convert the nodes into an appropriate list and then call the fromList function to build the map.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with writing some algorithms in both Ruby and Haskell and the latter wasn&#39;t giving the correct result so I wanted to output an intermediate state of the two programs and compare them.
I didn&#39;t do any fancy formatting of the output from either program so I had the raw data structures in text files which I needed to transform so that they were comparable.
The main thing I wanted to do was get each of the elements of the collection onto their own line.</description>

      <description>For the first few years that I worked professionally* every project that I worked on was different enough to the previous ones that I was always learning something new without having to put much effort in.
After a while this became less the case because I&#39;d seen more things and if I saw something even remotely similar I would abstract it away as something that I&#39;d done before.
A couple of months ago Martin Fowler wrote a blog post about priming and how research has showed that exposure to a stimulus influences a response to a later stimulus.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago I wrote a blog post describing our use of Mahout random forests for the Kaggle Digit Recogniser Problem and after seeing how long it took to create forests with 500+ trees I wanted to see if this could be sped up by parallelising the process.
From looking at the DecisionTree it seemed like it should be possible to create lots of small forests and then combine them together.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago my former colleague Kief Morris wrote a blog post describing the tracer bullet approach he&#39;s used to setup a continuous delivery pipeline on his current project.
 The idea is to get the simplest implementation of a pipeline in place, prioritizing a fully working skeleton that stretches across the full path to production over a fully featured, final-design functionality for each stage of the pipeline.  Kief goes on to explain in detail how we can go about executing this and it reminded of a project I worked on almost 3 years ago where we took a similar approach.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote a blog post describing my implementation of Kruskal&#39;s algorithm - a greedy algorithm using to find a minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph - and while it does the job it&#39;s not particularly quick.
It takes 20 seconds to calculate the MST for a 500 node, ~2000 edge graph.
One way that we can improve the performance of the algorithm is by storing the MST in a union find/disjoint set data structure.</description>

      <description>Last week I wrote a couple of posts showing different implementations of Prim&#39;s algorithm - an algorithm using to find a minimum spanning tree in a graph - and a similar algorithm is Kruskal&#39;s algorithm.
Kruskal&#39;s algorithm also finds a minimum spanning tree but it goes about it in a slightly different way.
Prim&#39;s algorithm takes an approach whereby we select nodes and then find connecting edges until we&#39;ve covered all the nodes.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote a blog post describing my implementation of Prim&#39;s Algorithm for the Algorithms 2 class and while it comes up with the right answer for the supplied data set it takes almost 30 seconds to do so!
In one of the lectures Tim Roughgarden points out that we&#39;re doing the same calculations multiple times to work out the next smallest edge to include in our minimal spanning tree and could use a heap to speed things up.</description>

      <description>One of the first programming assignments of the Algorithms 2 course was to code Prim&#39;s algorithm - a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected weighted undirected graph.
In simpler terms we need to find the path of least cost which connects all of the nodes together and there can&#39;t be any cycles in that path.
Wikipedia has a neat diagram which shows this more clearly:</description>

      <description>In our continued machine learning travels Jen and I have been building some classifiers using Weka and one thing we wanted to do was save the classifier and then reuse it later.
There is documentation for how to do this from the command line but we&#39;re doing everything programatically and wanted to be able to save our classifiers from Java code.
As it turns out it&#39;s not too tricky when you know which classes to call and saving a classifier to a file is as simple as this:</description>

      <description>I wanted to try running some of the machine learning algorithms that Jen and I have been playing around with on a beefier machine so I thought spinning up an AWS instance would be the best way to do that.
I built the JAR with the appropriate algorithms on my machine and then wanted to copy it up onto an AWS instance.
I could have used scp but I quite like the progress bar that you can get with rsync and since the JAR had somehow drifted to a size of 47MB the progress bar was useful.</description>

Jez&#39;s suggestion is for developers to take responsibility for the systems they create but he notes that:
[...] they need support from operations to understand how to build reliable software that can be continuous deployed to an unreliable platform that scales horizontally.</description>

      <description>In our latest attempt at Kaggle&amp;rsquo;s Digit Recognizer Jen and I decided to try out boosting on our random forest algorithm, an approach that Jen had come across in a talk at the Clojure Conj.
We couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any documentation that it was possible to apply boosting to Mahout&amp;rsquo;s random forest algorithm but we knew it was possible with Weka so we decided to use that instead!
As I understand it the way that boosting works in the context of random forests is that each of the trees in the forest will be assigned a weight based on how accurately it&amp;rsquo;s able to classify the data set and these weights are then used in the voting stage.</description>

      <description>A common approach we&amp;rsquo;ve been taking on some of the applications I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on recently is to decompose the system we&amp;rsquo;re building into smaller micro services which are independently deployable and communicate with each other over HTTP.
An advantage of decomposing systems like that is that we could have separate teams working on each service and then make use of a consumer driven contract as a way of ensuring the contract between them is correct.</description>

Unfortunately it&amp;rsquo;s not quite working at the moment so I wanted to debug the code and see whether the input parameters were being correctly translated from the CSV file.
Each input is an array containing 784 values but by default IntelliJ restricts you to seeing 100 elements which wasn&amp;rsquo;t helpful in my case since the early values tend to all be 0 and it&amp;rsquo;s not until you get half way through that you see different values:</description>

Angeleah defines black box abstraction like so:
 It is a technique for controlling complexity and abstracting detail. The point of doing this is to allow you to to build bigger things. Hopefully bigger boxes.</description>

      <description>In one of my first ever blog posts I wrote about the differences I&amp;rsquo;d experienced in learning the theory about a topic and then seeing it in practice.
The way I remember learning at school and university was that you learn all the theory first and then put it into practice but I typically don&amp;rsquo;t find myself doing this whenever I learn something new.
I spent a bit of time over the weekend learning more about neural networks as my colleague Jen Smith suggested this might be a more effective technique for getting a higher accuracy score on the Kaggle Digit Recogniser problem.</description>

      <description>Over the past couple of years I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on several different applications and one thing they had in common was that they had a huge feature which would take a few months to complete and initially seemed difficult to break down.
Since we favoured an incremental/iterative approach to building these features and wanted to add value in short feedback cycles we needed to find a way to break them down.</description>

      <description>My colleague Erik Doernenburg has written a couple of articles recently discussing the reasons why people buy and build IT solutions and one part in particular resonated with me:
 it is also possible, and not uncommon, that the software package does not do exactly what the business needs, leading to decreased productivity and lost opportunities.  I feel like there&amp;rsquo;s a mindset change once you start thinking which package you could buy to solve your problem whereby you stop solving the problem you actually have and focus instead on what features the package offers.</description>

      <description>On most of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on over the last couple of years we&amp;rsquo;ve made use of feature toggles that we used to turn pending features on and off while they were still being built but while reading Web Operations I came across another usage.
In the chapter titled &amp;lsquo;Dev and Ops Collaboration and Cooperation&amp;rsquo; Paul Hammond suggests the following:
 Eventually some of your infrastructure will fail in an unexpected way.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I was playing around with some data stored in a CSV file and wanted to do a simple check on the quality of the data by making sure that each line had the same number of fields.
One way this can be done is with awk:
awk -F &amp;quot;,&amp;quot; &#39; { print NF-1 } &#39; file.csv  Here we&amp;rsquo;re specifying the file separator -F as &amp;lsquo;,&amp;rsquo; and then using the NF (number of fields) variable to print how many commas there are on the line.</description>

      <title>Clojure: Thread last (-&gt;&gt;) vs Thread first (-&gt;)</title>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2012/11/06/clojure-thread-last-vs-thread-first/</guid>
      <description>In many of the Clojure examples that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across the thread last (-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;) macro is used to make it easier (for people from a non lispy background!) to see the transformations that the initial data structure is going through.
In one of my recent posts I showed how Jen &amp;amp; I had rewritten Mahout&amp;rsquo;s entropy function in Clojure:
(defn calculate-entropy [counts data-size] (-&amp;gt;&amp;gt; counts (remove #{0}) (map (partial individual-entropy data-size)) (reduce +)))  Here we are using the thread last operator to first pass counts as the last argument of the remove function on the next line, then to pass the result of that to the map function on the next line and so on.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been complaining recently to Jen and Bruce about the lack of a beginner&amp;rsquo;s guide to emacs paredit mode which seems to be the defacto approach for people working with Clojure and both pointed me to the paredit cheat sheet.
While it&amp;rsquo;s very comprehensive, I found that it&amp;rsquo;s a little overwhelming for a complete newbie like myself.
I therefore thought it&amp;rsquo;d be useful to write a bit about a couple of things that I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up from pairing with Jen on little bits of Clojure over the last couple of months.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a couple of previous posts Jen and I have been playing around with Mahout random forests and for a few hours last week we spent some time looking through the code to see how it worked.
In particular we came across an entropy function which is used to determine how good a particular &amp;lsquo;split&amp;rsquo; point in a decision tree is going to be.
I quite like the following definition:  The level of certainty of a particular decision can be measured as a number from 1 (completely uncertain) to 0 (completely certain).</description>

      <description>One of the things that I wanted to do while playing around with random forests using Mahout was to save the random forest and then use use it again which is something Mahout does cater for.
It was actually much easier to do this than I&amp;rsquo;d expected and assuming that we already have a DecisionForest built we&amp;rsquo;d just need the following code to save it to disc:
int numberOfTrees = 1; Data data = loadData(.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written previously about the K-means approach that Jen and I took when trying to solve Kaggle&amp;rsquo;s Digit Recognizer and having stalled at about 80% accuracy we decided to try one of the algorithms suggested in the tutorials section - the random forest!
We initially used a clojure random forests library but struggled to build the random forest from the training set data in a reasonable amount of time so we switched to Mahout&amp;rsquo;s version which is based on Leo Breiman&amp;rsquo;s random forests paper.</description>

      <title>Retrospectives: An alternative safety check</title>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2012/10/27/retrospectives-an-alternative-safety-check/</guid>
      <description>At the start of most of the retrospectives I&amp;rsquo;ve been part of we&amp;rsquo;ve followed the safety check ritual whereby each person participating has to write a number from 1-5 on a sticky describing how they&amp;rsquo;ll be participating in the retrospective.
1 means you&amp;rsquo;ll probably keep quiet and not say much, 5 means you&amp;rsquo;re perfectly comfortable saying anything and the other numbers fall in between those two extremes.
In my experiences it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a fruitless exercise because its viewed that a higher number is &amp;lsquo;better&amp;rsquo; and therefore the minimum people will tend to write down is &amp;lsquo;3&amp;rsquo; because they don&amp;rsquo;t want to stand out or cause a problem.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote a blog post explaining how Jen and I used the K-means algorithm to classify digits in Kaggle&amp;rsquo;s Digit Recognizer problem and one of the things we&amp;rsquo;d read was that with this algorithm you often end up with situations where it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to classify a new item because if falls between two labels.
We decided to have a look at the output of our classifier function to see whether or not that was the case.</description>

      <description>In the latest version of the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar one of the areas covered is &amp;lsquo;configuration in DNS&amp;rsquo;, a term which I first came across earlier in the year from a mailing list post by my former colleague Daniel Worthington-Bodart.
The radar describes it like so:
 Application deployments often suffer from an excess of environment-specific configuration settings, including the hostnames of dependent services. Configuration in DNS is a valuable technique to reduce this complexity by using standard hostnames like ‘mail’ or ‘db’ and have DNS resolve to the correct host for that environment.</description>

      <description>Over the past couple of months Jen and I have been playing around with the Kaggle Digit Recognizer problem - a &amp;lsquo;competition&amp;rsquo; created to introduce people to Machine Learning.
 The goal in this competition is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is.  You are given an input file which contains multiple rows each containing 784 pixel values representing a 28x28 pixel image as well as a label indicating which number that image actually represents.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago Joshua Kerievsky wrote a post describing how he and his teams don&amp;rsquo;t use story points anymore because of the problems they&amp;rsquo;d had with them which included:
 Story Point Inflation - inflating estimates of stories so that the velocity for an iteration is higher Comparing teams by points - judging comparative performance of teams by how many points they&#39;re able to complete  On the team I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on we still estimate the relative size of stories using points but we don&amp;rsquo;t use velocity per iteration to keep score - most of the time it&amp;rsquo;s barely even mentioned.</description>

      <description>One of the most unexpected things that I picked up while pairing with Ashok for a few days in August/September is his ability to pick the simplest solution when confronted with a problem.
On numerous occasions we&amp;rsquo;d be trying to do something and I&amp;rsquo;d end up on a yak shaving mission trying to get a complicated approach to work while he watched on with bemusement.
I thought I&amp;rsquo;d actually learnt this lesson from working with Ashok but on a couple of occasions over the last week I&amp;rsquo;ve caught myself doing the same thing again!</description>

      <description>On my current project we&amp;rsquo;ve been setting up production and staging environments and Shodhan came up with the idea of making staging and production identical to the point that a machine wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even know what environment it was in.
Identical in this sense means:
 Puppet doesn&#39;t know which environment the machine is in. Our factor variables suggest the environment is production. We set the RACK_ENV variable to production so applications don&#39;t know what environment they&#39;re in.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re using varnish to cache all the requests that come through our web servers and especially in our pre-production environments we deploy quite frequently and want to see the changes that we&amp;rsquo;ve made.
This means that we need to purge the pages we&amp;rsquo;re accessing from varnish so that it will actually pass the request through to the application server and serve up the latest version of the page.
For some reason my google-fu when trying to remember/work out how to do this has always been weak but my colleague Shodhan helped me understand how to do this today so I thought I better record it so I don&amp;rsquo;t forget!</description>

      <description>About a month ago I wrote about some problems I was having working with Windows generated CSV files which had a Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the file and I described a way to get rid of it using awk.
It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a long winded process though and I always forget what the parameters I need to pass to awk are so I thought it would probably be quicker if I could just work out a way to get rid of the BOM using an editor.</description>

 John Graham Cunningham opened the series of keynotes with a talk describing the problems British Rail had in 1955 when trying to calculate the distances between all train stations and comparing them to the problems we have today. British Rail were trying to solve a graph problem when people didn&#39;t know about graphs and Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm hadn&#39;t been invented and it was effectively invented on this project but never publicised.</description>

Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with a couple of different things in this area over the last 4&amp;frasl;5 months I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be interesting to come along and see what people much more experienced in this area had to say!</description>

      <description>In some of the recent work I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing with neo4j the queries I&amp;rsquo;ve written have been summing up the values from multiple nodes and after a certain number is reached the value returned used scientific notation.
For example in a cypher query like this:
START category = node:categories(&#39;category_id:1&#39;) MATCH p = category-[:has_child*1..5]-&amp;gt;subCategory-[:has_product]-&amp;gt;product-[:sold]-&amp;gt;sales RETURN EXTRACT(n in NODES(p) : n.category_id?),subCategory.category_id, SUM(sales.sales)  I might get a result set like this:

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I spent a bit of time writing a Ruby DSL to automate the setup of load balancers, firewall and NAT rules through the VCloud API.
The VCloud API deals primarily in XML so the DSL is just a thin layer which creates the appropriate mark up.
When we started out we configured everything manually through the web console and then exported the XML so the first thing that the DSL needed to do was create XML that matched what we already had.</description>

      <description>Over the past month or so Ashok and I have been helping one of our clients explore and visualise some of their data and one of the first things we needed to do was make sense of the data that was available.
Start small Ashok suggested that we work with a subset of our eventual data set so that we could get a feel for the data and quickly see whether what we were planning to do made sense.</description>

      <description>On Friday Martin, Darren and I were discussing the ThoughtWorks graph that I was working on earlier in the year and Martin pointed out that an interesting aspect of this type of work is that the data you want to work with isn&amp;rsquo;t easily available.
You therefore need to find a way to scrap the data together to make some headway and then maybe at a later stage once some progress has been made it will become easier to replace that with a cleaner solution.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re using upstart to handle the processes running on our machines and since the haproxy package only came package with an init.d script we wanted to make it upstartified.
When defining an upstart script you need to specify an expect stanza in which you specify whether or not the process which you&amp;rsquo;re launching is going to fork.
 If you do not specify the expect stanza, Upstart will track the life cycle of the first PID that it executes in the exec or script stanzas.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a previous post I recently moved a bunch of neo4j data loading code from Ruby to Java and as part of that process I needed to parse some CSV files.
In Ruby I was using FasterCSV which became the standard CSV library from Ruby 1.9 but it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I had to parse CSV files in Java so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure which library to use.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve often heard people talking about Network Address Translation (NAT) but I never really understood exactly how it worked until we started configuring some virtual data centres on my current project.
This is an attempt at documenting my own current understanding so I won&amp;rsquo;t forget in future.
In our case we&amp;rsquo;ve been provisioning a bunch of machines into different private networks, and each machine therefore has an IP in the range of IPv4 addresses reserved for private networks:</description>

      <description>About a year and a half ago I wrote about the sunk cost fallacy which is defined like so:
 The Misconception: You make rational decisions based on the future value of objects, investments and experiences. The Truth: Your decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.  Over the past few weeks Ashok and I have been doing some exploration of one of our client&amp;rsquo;s data by modelling it in a neo4j graph and seeing what interesting things the traversals reveal.</description>

A few weeks ago I wrote about a UTF-8 byte order mark (BOM) that I wanted to remove from a file I was working on and I realised this evening that there were some other files with the same problem.</description>

      <description>I use zsh on my Mac terminal and in general I prefer it to bash but it has an annoying default setting whereby when you try to repeat a command via substituted history expansion it asks you to verify that.
For example let&amp;rsquo;s say by mistake I try to vi into a directory rather than cd&amp;rsquo;ing into it:

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with some data modelled in neo4j recently and one thing I wanted to do is run an adhoc query in the neo4j-shell and grab the results and do some text manipulation on them.
For example I wrote a query which outputted the following to the screen and I wanted to sum together all the values in the 3rd column:
| [&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;3&amp;quot;] | &amp;quot;3&amp;quot; | 1234567 | | [&amp;quot;4&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;5&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;6&amp;quot;] | &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; | 8910112 |  Initially I was pasting the output into a text file and then running the following sequence of commands to work it out:</description>

      <description>One of the applications that Phil and I were deploying today needed a MySQL server and part of our puppet code to provision that node type runs a command to setup the privileges for a database user.
The unevaluated puppet code reads like this:
/usr/bin/mysql -h ${host} -uroot ${rootpassarg} -e &amp;quot;grant all on ${name}.* to ${user}@&#39;${remote_host}&#39; identified by &#39;$password&#39;; flush privileges;&amp;quot;  In the application we were deploying that expanded into something like this:</description>

Eventually we got bored of doing that so we figured out a nice little one liner to use instead:

We wanted to check what the open file descriptors of logstash-client were so we first had to grab its process id:

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been loading some data into neo4j from a CSV file - creating one node per row and using the value in the first column as the index lookup for the node.
Unfortunately the index lookup wasn&amp;rsquo;t working for the first row but was for every other row.
By coincidence we started saving each row into a hash map and were then able to see what was going wrong:

I was intrigued what the book would be like because the skill gap between Pat and me with respect to facilitating retrospectives is huge and I&amp;rsquo;ve often found that experts in a subject can have a tendency to be a bit preachy when writing about their subject!</description>

 Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has &#34;cursed&#34; us. And it becomes difficult for us to share out knowledge with others, because can&#39;t readily re-create our listeners&#39; state of mind.</description>

(paraphrasing)  He suggested that in a lot of talks he&amp;rsquo;d seen the presenter rattle off a bunch of information about a topic but hadn&amp;rsquo;t provided any insight into their own experience with the topic.
If two people give a talk on the same topic they therefore end up being fairly similar talks even though each person may have a totally different perspective.</description>

      <description>We wanted to be able to ssh into some machines which were behind a firewall so we set up a jumpbox which our firewall directed any traffic on port 22 towards.
Initially if we wanted to SSH onto a machine inside the network we&amp;rsquo;d have to do a two step process:
$ ssh jumpbox # now on the jumpbx $ ssh internal-network-machine  That got a bit annoying after a while so Sam showed us a neat way of proxying the second ssh command through the first one by making use of netcat.</description>

      <description>I started playing around with the TFL Bus stop location and routes API and one of the annoying things about the data is that it uses easting/northing values to describe the location of bus stops rather than lat/longs.
The first few lines of the CSV file look like this:
1000,91532,490000266G,WESTMINSTER STN &amp;lt;&amp;gt; / PARLIAMENT SQUARE,530171,179738,177,0K08,0 10001,72689,490013793E,TREVOR CLOSE,515781,174783,78,NB16,0 10002,48461,490000108F,HIGHBURY CORNER,531614,184603,5,C902,0  For each of the stops I wanted to convert from the easting/northing value to the equivalent lat/long value but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a simple way of doing it in code although I did come across an API that would do it for me.</description>

      <description>For the last 5 weeks or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with puppet every day to automate the configuration of various nodes in our stack and my most interesting observation so far is that you really need to keep your discipline when doing this type of work.
We can keep that discipline in three main ways when developing modules.
Running from scratch Configuring various bits of software seems to follow the 80&amp;frasl;20 rule and we get very close to having each thing working quite quickly but then end up spending a disproportionate amount of time tweaking the last little bits.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve read about the Unix &amp;lsquo;tee&amp;rsquo; command before but never found a reason to use it until the last few weeks.
One of the things I repeatedly do by mistake is open /etc/hosts without sudo and then try to make changes to it:
$ vi /etc/hosts # Editing it leads to the dreaded &#39;W10: Changing a readonly file&#39;  I always used to close the file and then re-open it with sudo but I recently came across an approach which allows us to use &amp;lsquo;tee&amp;rsquo; to get around the problem.</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time this evening extracting some data from the ThoughtWorks graph for our marketing team who were interested in anything related to our three European offices in London, Manchester and Hamburg.
The most interesting things we can explore relate to the relationship between people and the offices.
The model around people and offices looks like this:
  I added a &amp;lsquo;current_home_office&amp;rsquo; relationship to make it easier to quickly get to the nodes of people who are currently working in a specific office.</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of Sunday playing around with R and one thing I wanted to do was map a function over a collection of values and transform each value slightly.
I loaded my data set using the &amp;lsquo;Import Dataset&amp;rsquo; option in R Studio (suggested to me by Rob) which gets converted to the following function call:

      <description>A few weeks ago I did a presentation at the ThoughtWorks EU away day on the graph I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing using neo4j and I wanted to show who the most connected people in each of our European offices were.
I started with the following cypher query:
START n = node(*) MATCH n-[r:colleagues*1..2]-&amp;gt;c, n-[r2:member_of]-&amp;gt;office WHERE n.type? = &#39;person&#39; AND (NOT(HAS(r2.end_date))) AND office.name = &#39;London - UK South&#39; AND (NOT(HAS(c.thoughtquitter))) RETURN n.name, count(distinct(c)) AS connections, office.</description>

      <description>In May I wrote a blog post explaining how I&amp;rsquo;d been designing a neo4j graph by thinking about what questions I wanted to answer about the data.
In the comments Josh Adell gave me the following advice:
 The neat things about graphs is that multiple subgraphs can live in the same data-space. ...
Keep your data model rich! Don&#39;t be afraid to have as many relationships as you need. The power of graph databases comes from finding surprising results when you have strongly interconnected data.</description>

      <description>I was looking back at some code I wrote a few months ago to query a neo4j database to find the shortest path between two people via the colleagues relationships that exist.

The initial code, written using neography, looked like this:
neo = Neography::Rest.new start_node = neo.get_node(start_node_id) destination_node = neo.get_node(destination_node_id) neo.get_paths(start_node, destination_node, { &amp;quot;type&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;colleagues&amp;quot; }, depth = 3, algorithm = &amp;quot;shortestPath&amp;quot;)  The neography code eventually makes a POST request to /node/{start_id}/paths and provides a JSON payload containing the other information about the query.</description>

      <description>Phil and I spent some of Friday afternoon configuring statsd:
 A network daemon that runs on the Node.js platform and listens for statistics, like counters and timers, sent over UDP and sends aggregates to one or more pluggable backend services  We configured it to listen on its default port 8125 and then used netcat to send UDP packets to see if it was working like so:
echo -n &amp;quot;blah:36|c&amp;quot; | nc -w 1 -u -4 localhost 8125  We used tcpdump to capture any UDP packets on port 8125 like so:</description>

      <description>As part of some work we were doing last week Phil and I needed to send UDP packets to a local port and check that they were being picked up.
We initially tried sending a UDP packet to localhost port 8125 using netcat like so:
echo -n &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; | nc -w 1 -u localhost 8125  That message wasn&amp;rsquo;t being received by the application listening on the port so Phil decided to try and send the same packet from Ruby which worked fine:</description>

      <description>One of the awesome things about working with clojure is that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to wire up clojure files in emacs to a REPL by making use of Slime/Swank.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started using Racket to work through the examples in The Little Schemer and wanted to achieve a similar thing there.
 Racket is a modern programming language in the Lisp/Scheme family, suitable for a wide range of applications  I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about configuring emacs so I made use of Phil Halgelberg&amp;rsquo;s emacs-starter-kit which is available on github.</description>

      <description>I recently read a blog post by Julian Boot titled &amp;lsquo;visualisation without analysis is fine&amp;rsquo; where he suggests that we can learn things from visualising data in the right way - detailed statistical analysis isn&amp;rsquo;t always necessary.
I thought this was quite an interesting observation because over the past couple of months I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with ThoughtWorks data and looking at different ways to visualise aspects of the data.</description>

      <description>My colleague Shohdan and I spent a couple of days last week wiring up various monitoring metrics into ganglia and while most of them come built in, we also found some  python based modules that we wanted to use.
Unfortunately we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any instructions on github explaining how to set them up but after a bit of trial and error we figured it out.
One of the modules that we wanted to use was diskstat which provides I/O wait time metrics which we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find in the built in modules.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve paired a few times with my colleague Phil Potter over the last couple of weeks and since he&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a ninja with bash shortcuts/commands I wanted to record some of the things he&amp;rsquo;s shown me so I won&amp;rsquo;t forget them!
Let&amp;rsquo;s say we&amp;rsquo;re in the &amp;lsquo;/tmp&amp;rsquo; directory and want to create a folder a few levels down but forget to pass the &amp;lsquo;-p&amp;rsquo; option to &amp;lsquo;mkdir&amp;rsquo;:
$ mkdir blah/de/blah mkdir: cannot create directory `blah/de/blah&#39;: No such file or directory  One way of fixing that would be to press the up arrow and navigate along the previous command and put in the &amp;lsquo;-p&amp;rsquo; flag but it&amp;rsquo;s a bit fiddly so instead we can do the following:</description>

Since several of the commands require having write access to &amp;lsquo;root&amp;rsquo; folders we need to run &amp;lsquo;puppet apply&amp;rsquo; as a super user using sudo. We also need to run it in the context of some environment variables which the root user has.</description>

      <description>On my ThoughtWorks neo4j there are now two different types of relationships between people nodes - they can either be colleagues or one can be the sponsor of the other.
The graph looks like this:
I wanted to get a list of all the sponsor pairs but also have some indicator of whether the two people have worked together.
I started off by getting all of the sponsor pairs:
START n = node(*) MATCH n-[r:sponsor_of]-&amp;gt;n2 RETURN n.</description>

      <description>I think one of the first things that I learnt about dealing with users in a data store is that you should never use name as a primary key because their might be two people with the same name.
Despite knowing that I foolishly chose to ignore this knowledge when building my neo4j graph and used name as the key for the Lucene index.
I thought I&amp;rsquo;d got away with it but NO!</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re using the Brightbox Ruby repository to get the versions of Ruby which we install on our machines and although we eventually put the configuration for this repository into Puppet we initially tested it out on a local VM.
To start with you need to add the repository to /etc/apt/sources.list:
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/brightbox/ruby-ng/ubuntu lucid main  To get that picked up we run the following:

      <description>At ThoughtWorks we don&amp;rsquo;t have line managers but people can choose to have a sponsor - typically someone who has worked in the company for longer/has more experience in the industry than them - who can help them navigate the organisation better.
From hearing people talk about sponsors over the last 6 years it seemed like quite a few people sponsored the majority and there were probably a few people who didn&amp;rsquo;t have a sponsor.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been continuing to work through the exercises in The Little Schemer and came across a problem which needed me to write a function to take a mixed list of Integers and Strings and filter out the Integers.
As I mentioned in my previous post I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing the exercises in Haskell but I thought I might struggle with that approach here because Haskell collections are homogeneous i.e. all the elements need to be of the same type.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I asked the twittersphere for some advice on how I could get better at writing recursive functions and one of the pieces of advice was to work through The Little Schemer.
I first heard about The Little Schemer a couple of years ago and after going through the first few pages I got bored and gave up.
I still found the first few pages a bit trivial this time around as well but my colleague Jen Smith encouraged me to keep going and once I&amp;rsquo;d got about 20 pages in it became clearer to me why the first few pages had been written the way they had.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in another post about a month ago I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with a neo4j graph in which I have the following relationship between nodes:
One thing I wanted to do was work out which node is the most connected on the graph, which would tell me who&amp;rsquo;s worked with the most people.
I started off with the following cypher query:
query = &amp;quot; START n = node(*)&amp;quot; query &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot; MATCH n-[r:colleagues]-&amp;gt;c&amp;quot; query &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot; WHERE n.</description>

This is an example of what was going wrong:

      <description>In my continued reading of SICP I wanted to recreate a &amp;lsquo;sum&amp;rsquo; function used to demonstrate a function which could take another function as one of its parameters.
In Scheme the function is defined like this:
(define (sum term a next b) (if (&amp;gt; a b) 0 (+ (term a) (sum term (next a) next b))))  And can be used like this to sum the values between two numbers:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working through some of the SICP problems in Haskell and for problem 1.22 you need to write a function which will indicate the first 3 prime numbers above a starting value.
It is also suggested to only consider odd numbers so to find the prime numbers above 1000 the function call would look like this:
&amp;gt; searchForPrimes [1001,1003..] [1009,1013,1019]  I wanted to be able to feed in the range of numbers from the command line so that I&amp;rsquo;d be able to call the function with different values and see how long it took to work it out.</description>

      <description>I wanted to get a blank version of Google Maps without any of the country names on for a visualisation I&amp;rsquo;m working on but I&amp;rsquo;d been led to believe that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually possible.
In actual fact we do have control over whether the labels are shown via the &amp;lsquo;styles&amp;rsquo; option which we can call on the map.
In my case the code looks like this:
var map = new google.</description>

      <description>I recently came across Dan Piponi&amp;rsquo;s blog post &amp;lsquo;Haskell Monoids &amp;amp; their Uses&amp;rsquo; and towards the end of the post he suggests creating monoids to work out the maximum and minimum values of a Foldable value in one pass.
 The Foldable type class provides a generic approach to walking through a datastructure, accumulating values as we go. The foldMap function applies a function to each element of our structure and then accumulates the return values of each of these applications.</description>

      <description>In my continued attempts to learn QuickCheck, one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing is comparing the results of my brute force and divide &amp;amp; conquer versions of the closest pairs algorithm.
I started with this property:
let prop_dc_bf xs = (length xs &amp;gt; 2) ==&amp;gt; (fromJust $ bfClosest xs) == dcClosest xs  And then ran it from GHCI, which resulted in the following error:

data Row = Row { shortListed :: Bool, cost :: Float, distance1 :: Int, distance2 :: Int } deriving (Show, Eq)  import Data.</description>

Since the last time I worked in Scala I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with Haskell where type classes are much more common - for example if we want to compare two values we need to make sure that their type extends the &amp;lsquo;Eq&amp;rsquo; type class.</description>

I first needed to install test-framework and some dependencies using cabal:

This is the initial version that I wrote:
dcClosest :: (Ord a, Floating a) =&amp;gt; [Point a] -&amp;gt; (Point a, Point a) dcClosest pairs if length pairs &amp;lt;= 3 then = fromJust $ bfClosest pairs else foldl (\closest (p1:p2:_) -&amp;gt; if distance (p1, p2) &amp;lt; distance closest then (p1, p2) else closest) closestPair (windowed 2 pairsWithinMinimumDelta) where sortedByX = sortBy compare pairs	(leftByX:rightByX:_) = chunk (length sortedByX `div` 2) sortedByX closestPair = if distance closestLeftPair &amp;lt; distance closestRightPair then closestLeftPair else closestRightPair where closestLeftPair = dcClosest leftByX closestRightPair = dcClosest rightByX pairsWithinMinimumDelta = sortBy (compare `on` snd) $ filter withinMinimumDelta sortedByX where withinMinimumDelta (x, _) = abs (xMidPoint - x) &amp;lt;= distance closestPair where (xMidPoint, _) = last leftByX  We can remove the first if statement which checks the length of the list and replace it with pattern matching code like so:</description>

For example say we want to use the read function to parse an input string into an integer.
We could do this:
&amp;gt; read &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; :: Int 1  But if we just evaluate the function alone and try and assign the result without casting to a type we get an exception:</description>

      <description>A couple of years ago I wrote a post describing an approach my then colleague Christian Blunden used to help improve the performance of an application where you try to do expensive things less or find another way to do them.
On the application I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on we load reference data from an Oracle database into memory based on configurations provided by the user.
There are multiple configurations and then multiple ways that those configurations can be priced so we have two nested for loops in which we load data and then perform calculations on it.</description>

      <description>I spent a few hours writing a simple front end on top of the Rabin Karp algorithm so that I could show the line of the first occurrence of a pattern in a piece of text on the shell.
I thought it would be quite cool if I could highlight the appropriate text on the line like how grep does when the &amp;lsquo;&amp;ndash;color=auto&amp;rsquo; flag is supplied.
We can make use of ANSI escape codes to do this.</description>

      <description>In my last post about the Rabin Karp algorithm I mentioned that I was having some problems when trying to write a hash function which closely matched its English description.
 ((rm-1 * ascii char) + (rm-2 * ascii char) + … (r0 * ascii char)) % q where r = 256, q = 1920475943  This is my current version of the hash function:
hash = hash&#39; globalR globalQ hash&#39; r q string m = foldl (\acc x -&amp;gt; (r * acc + ord x) `mod` q) 0 $ take m string  And my initial attempt to write the alternate version was this:</description>

      <description>I recently came across a blog post describing the Rabin Karp algorithm - an algorithm that uses hashing to find a pattern string in some text - and thought it would be interesting to try and write a version of it in Haskell.
This algorithm is typically used when we want to search for multiple pattern strings in a text e.g. when detecting plagiarism or a primitive way of detecting code duplication but my initial version only lets your search for one pattern.</description>

      <description>Over the last six weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been working through Stanford&amp;rsquo;s Design and Analysis of Algorithms I class and each week there&amp;rsquo;s been a programming assignment on a specific algorithm for which a huge data set is provided.
For the first couple of assignments I tried writing the code for the algorithm and then running it directly against the provided data set.
As you might imagine it never worked first time and this approach led to me becoming very frustrated because there&amp;rsquo;s no way of telling what went wrong.</description>

      <description>A month ago I wrote a post describing an approach my team has been taking to avoid premature abstractions whereby we leave code inline until we know enough about the domain to pull out meaningful classes or methods.
Since I wrote that post we&amp;rsquo;ve come across a couple of examples where there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a name to describe a data structure.
We are building a pricing engine where the input is a set of configurations and the output is a set of pricing rows associated with each configuration.</description>

The solution I came up was to create a Lucene index with an entry for each node and a common property on each document in the index so that I&amp;rsquo;d be able to get all the index entries easily.</description>

      <description>In the comments of my blog post describing the flood fill algorithm in Haskell David Turner pointed out that the way I was passing the grid around was quite error prone.
floodFill :: Array (Int, Int) Colour -&amp;gt; (Int, Int) -&amp;gt; Colour -&amp;gt; Colour -&amp;gt; Array (Int, Int) Colour floodFill grid point@(x, y) target replacement = if((not $ inBounds grid point) || grid ! (x,y) /= target) then grid else gridNorth where grid&#39; = replace grid point replacement gridEast = floodFill grid&#39; (x+1, y) target replacement gridWest = floodFill gridEast (x-1, y) target replacement gridSouth = floodFill gridWest (x, y+1) target replacement gridNorth = floodFill gridSouth (x, y-1) target replacement  I actually did pass the wrong grid variable around while I was writing it and ended up quite confused as to why it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working as I expected.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with neo4j using the neography gem to create a graph of all the people in ThoughtWorks and the connections between them based on working with each other.
I created a UI where you could type in the names of two people and see when they&amp;rsquo;ve worked together or the path between the shortest path between them if they haven&amp;rsquo;t.
I thought it would be cool to have auto complete functionality when typing in a name but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to partially query the index of people&amp;rsquo;s names that I&amp;rsquo;d created.</description>

      <description>One of the most common instincts of a developer when starting on a new team is to look at the way the application has been designed and find ways that it can be done differently.
Most often &amp;lsquo;differently&amp;rsquo; means that a pattern used in a previous project will be favoured and while I think it&amp;rsquo;s good to make use of experience that we&amp;rsquo;ve gained, we do miss out on some learning if we write every application the same way.</description>

      <description>My Prismatic news feed recently threw up an interesting tutorial titled &amp;lsquo;Haskell the Hard Way&amp;rsquo; which has an excellent and easy to understand section showing how to do IO in Haskell.
About half way down the page there&amp;rsquo;s an exercise to write a program which sums all its arguments which I thought I&amp;rsquo;d have a go at.
We need to use the System.getArgs function to get the arguments passed to the program.</description>

      <description>Flood fill is an algorithm used to work out which nodes are connected to a certain node in a multi dimensional array. In this case we&amp;rsquo;ll use a two dimensional array.
The idea is that we decide that we want to change the colour of one of the cells in the array and have its immediate neighbours who share its initial colour have their colour changed too i.e. the colour floods its way through the grid.</description>

      <description>Quite frequently I play around with 2D arrays in Haskell but I&amp;rsquo;ve never quite worked out how to print them in a way that makes it easy to see the contents.
I&amp;rsquo;m using the array from the &amp;lsquo;Data.Array&amp;rsquo; module because it seems to be easier to transform them into a new representation if I want to change a value in one of the cells.
The function to create one therefore looks like this:</description>

      <description>One of my favourite things about coding in Haskell is that I often end up pattern matching against data types.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with modelling cars coming into and out from a car park and changing the state of the car park accordingly.
I started with these data type definitions:
data CarParkState = Available Bool Int Int | AlmostFull Bool Int Int | Full Bool Int deriving (Show) data Action = Entering | Leaving deriving (Show) data Sticker = Handicap | None deriving (Show)  which were used in the following function:</description>

public class ProductSpeed { public ProductSpeed(String name) { ... } public ProductSpeed(String name, int order)) { } }  In the cases where the first constructor was used the order of the product was irrelevant.
When the second constructor was used we did care about it because we wanted to be able sort the products before showing them in a drop down list to the user.</description>

Given the following text in our file:

      <description>The design of the code which contains the main logic of the application that I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on looks a bit like the diagram on the right hand side:
 We load a bunch of stuff from an Oracle database, construct some objects from the data and then invoke a sequence of methods on those objects in order to execute our domain logic.
Typically we might expect to see unit level test against all the classes described in this diagram but we&amp;rsquo;ve actually been trying out an approach where we don&amp;rsquo;t test the orchestration code directly but rather only test it via the resource which makes use of it.</description>

 My initial solution looked like this:
routes :: (Int, Int) -&amp;gt; Int -&amp;gt; Int routes origin size = inner origin size where inner origin@(x, y) size | x == size &amp;amp;&amp;amp; y == size = 0 | x == size || y == size = 1 | otherwise = inner (x+1, y) size + inner (x, y+1) size  Which can be called like this:</description>

      <description>We wanted to be able to retain the value of a drop down menu that was being dynamically populated (via an AJAX call) when the user hit the back button but the AJAX request re-runs when we go hit back therefore losing our selection.
Our initial thinking was that we might be able to store the value of the dropdown in a hidden field and then restore it into the dropdown using jQuery on page load but that approach didn&amp;rsquo;t work since hidden fields don&amp;rsquo;t seem to retain their values when you hit back.</description>

We normally end up forgetting how to construct a query so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d document it.
Assuming we have a table table_with_shape which has a column shape which is a polygon, if we want to check whether a lat/long value interacts with that shape we can do that with the following query:</description>

 Every time you call get on an Option a kitten dies.  As Channing points out in the comments he was referring to unguarded calls to &amp;lsquo;get&amp;rsquo; which would lead to an exception if the Option was empty, therefore pretty much defeating the point of using an Option in the first place!
We&amp;rsquo;re using Dan Bodart&amp;rsquo;s totallylazy library on the application I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on and in fact were calling &amp;lsquo;get&amp;rsquo; on an Option so I wanted to see if we could get rid of it.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my last post I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a bit of this evening writing a merge sort function and one of the mistakes I made a few times was incorrectly passing arguments to the recursive calls of &amp;lsquo;merge&amp;rsquo;.
For example, this is one of the earlier versions of the function:
middle :: [Int] -&amp;gt; Int middle = floor . (\y -&amp;gt; y / 2) . fromIntegral . length	msort :: [Int] -&amp;gt; [Int] msort unsorted = let n = middle unsorted in if n == 0 then unsorted else let (left, right) = splitAt n unsorted in merge (msort left) (msort right) where merge [] right = right merge left [] = left merge left@(x:xs) right@(y:ys) = if x &amp;lt; y then x : merge(xs, right) else y : merge (left, ys)  Which doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually compile:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with writing merge sort in Haskell and eventually ended up with the following function:
msort :: [Int] -&amp;gt; [Int] msort unsorted = let n = floor (fromIntegral(length unsorted) / 2) in if n == 0 then unsorted else let (left, right) = splitAt n unsorted in merge (msort left) (msort right) where merge [] right = right merge left [] = left merge left@(x:xs) right@(y:ys) = if x &amp;lt; y then x : merge xs right else y : merge left ys  The 3rd line was annoying me as it has way too many brackets on it and I was fairly sure that it should be possible to just combine the functions like I learnt to do in F# a few years ago.</description>

      <description>The first programming questions of algo-class requires you to calculate the number of inversions it would take using merge sort to sort a collection in ascending order.
I found quite a nice explanation here too:
 Finding &#34;similarity&#34; between two rankings. Given a sequence of n numbers 1..n (assume all numbers are distinct). Define a measure that tells us how far this list is from being in ascending order. The value should be 0 if a_1 The simple/naive way of solving this problem is to iterate through the collection in two loops and compare each value and its current index with the others, looking for ones which are not in the right order.</description>

I realised while watching him solve the problem that we&amp;rsquo;d been using quite different approaches to solving the problem and that his way worked way better than mine, at least in this context.</description>

      <description>One of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt while developing code in an incremental way is that the way the code should be designed isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be obvious straight away so we need to be patience and wait for it to emerge.
There&amp;rsquo;s often a tendency to pull out classes or methods but more recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to follow an approach where I leave the code in one class/method and play around with/study it until I see a good abstraction to make.</description>

      <description>On the current application I&amp;rsquo;m working on we need to make use of some data which comes from another system so we&amp;rsquo;ve created an import script which creates a copy of that data so that we can use it in our application.
In general we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying not to do too much manipulation of the data and keeping it close to the initial structure so that if something goes wrong with the import we can more easily trace the problem back to the original data source.</description>

      <description>A couple of years ago when I was playing around with F# I came across the Seq.windowed function which allows you to create a sliding window of a specific size over a collection.
Taking an example from the F# documentation page:
let seqNumbers = [ 1.0; 1.5; 2.0; 1.5; 1.0; 1.5 ] :&amp;gt; seq&amp;lt;float&amp;gt; let seqWindows = Seq.windowed 3 seqNumbers  We end up with this:
Initial sequence: 1.0 1.5 2.</description>

 By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13. What is the 10 001st prime number?  I read that the Sieve of Eratosthenes is a useful algorithm for working out all the prime numbers and there&amp;rsquo;s a page on the Literate Programs wiki explaining how to derive them using it.</description>

      <description>Recently we wanted to create a domain object which needed to have an external dependency in order to do a calculation and we wanted to be able to stub out that dependency in our tests.
Originally we were just new&amp;rsquo;ing up the dependency inside the domain class but that makes it impossible to control it&amp;rsquo;s value in a test.
Equally it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like we should be passing that dependency into the constructor of the domain object since it&amp;rsquo;s not a piece of state which defines the object, just something that it uses.</description>

 Typing fewer characters doesn’t actually optimize for writing either - the intuition behind that statement is quite easy: imagine you had to write a book. However, instead of writing it in English, you just wrote the gzipped version of the book directly.</description>

      <description>On most of the applications I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on we&amp;rsquo;ve tended to organise/package classes by the function that they have or the layer that they fit in.
A typical package structure might therefore end up looking like this:
 com.awesome.project  common  StringUtils     controllers  LocationController PricingController     domain  Address Cost CostFactory Location Price     repositories  LocationRepository PriceRepository     services  LocationService      This works reasonably well and allows you to find code which is similar in function but I find that more often than not a lot of the code that lives immediately around where you currently are isn&amp;rsquo;t actually relevant at the time.</description>

 Truly effective video game designers know how to create a sense of progress for players within all stages of a game. Truly effective managers know how to do the same for their subordinates.  While a tech lead might not like to be referred to as a manager I think part of the role does involve helping developers to make progress and the best ones I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with seem to do that instinctively.</description>

      <description>Every now and then I want to get the JDK source code onto a new machine and it always seems to take me longer than I expect it to so this post is an attempt to help future me!
Googling for this takes me to this page and I always think I&amp;rsquo;ll just checkout the SVN repository and hook that up but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be available.

      <description>In my latest post I described an approach we&amp;rsquo;d been taking when analysing how to rewrite part of an existing system so that we could build the new version in an incremental way.
Towards the end I pointed out that we weren&amp;rsquo;t actually going to be using an incremental approach as we&amp;rsquo;d initially thought which was due to a couple of constraints that we have to work under.
Hardware provisioning One of the main reasons that we favoured an incremental approach is that we&amp;rsquo;d be able to deploy to production early which would allow us to show a quicker return on investment.</description>

      <description>During December/early January we spent some time analysing an existing system which we were looking to rewrite and our approach was to look for how we could do this in an incremental way.
In order to do that we needed to look for what Michael Feathers refers to as a seam:
 A seam is a place where you can alter behaviour in your program without editing in that place  On previous times when I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about seams it&amp;rsquo;s been at a code level inside a single application but this time there were more than one pieces interacting.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around a little with Goose - a library for extracting the main body of text from web pages - and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try converting some of the code to be more scala-esque in style.
The API of the various classes/methods is designed so it&amp;rsquo;s interoperable with Java code but in order to use functions like map/filter we need the collection to be a Scala one.
That&amp;rsquo;s achieved by importing &amp;lsquo;scala.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a post last week we&amp;rsquo;ve been automating the setup of our developer machines with puppet over the last week and one thing that we&amp;rsquo;ve learnt is that you need to be careful about how you define dependencies.
The aim is to get your scripts to the point where the outcome is reasonably deterministic so that we can have confidence they&amp;rsquo;re going to work the next we run them.</description>

      <description>Over the last 3&amp;frasl;4 months I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with the idea of using pomodoros to track all coding/software related stuff that I do outside of work.
I originally started using this technique while I was doing the programming assignments for ml-class because I wanted to know how much time I was spending on it each week and make sure I didn&amp;rsquo;t run down rabbit holes too often.
One interesting observation that I noticed from keeping the data of these pomodoros was that while during the early programming assignments it would take me 7 or 8 pomodoros to finish, by the end it was down to around 4.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been spending some time trying to setup our developer environment on a Oracle Linux 5.7 build and one of the first steps was to install Puppet as we&amp;rsquo;ve already created scripts which automate the installation of most things.
Unfortunately Oracle Linux builds don&amp;rsquo;t come with any yum repos configured so when you run the following command&amp;hellip;
ls -alh /etc/yum.repos.d/  &amp;hellip;you don&amp;rsquo;t see anything :(
We eventually realised that there are a list of public yum repositories on the Oracle website, of which we needed to download the definition for Oracle Linux 5 like so:</description>

      <description>I recently came across Carl Erickson&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;small teams are dramatically more efficient than large teams&amp;rsquo; blog post which reminded me of something which my colleague Ashok suggested as a useful way for determining team size - the application footprint.
As I understand it the application footprint is applicable for an application at a given point in time and determines how many parallel tasks/streams of work we have.
In the case of the project that I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on there are 3 separate components which need to interact with each other via an API but otherwise are independent.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago a slide deck from an Esther Derby presentation on retrospectives was doing the rounds on twitter and one thing that I found interesting in the deck was the suggestion that a retrospective needs to be focused in some way.
I&amp;rsquo;ve participated in a few focused retrospectives over the past 7&amp;frasl;8 months and I think there are some things to be careful about when we decide to focus on something specific rather than just looking back at a time period in general.</description>

      <description>I like using Wireshark to have a look at the traffic going across different interfaces but because it shows what&amp;rsquo;s happening across the wire by the packet it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult to tell what a request/response looked like.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with restfulie/Vraptor today so I wanted to be able to see the request/response pair when something wasn&amp;rsquo;t working.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it was actually possible but this post on StackOverflow describes how.</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time this afternoon trying to export an Oracle test database so that we could use it locally using the exp tool.
I had to connect to exp like this:
exp user/password@remote_address  And then filled in the other parameters interactively.
Unfortunately when I tried to actually export the specified tables I got the following error message:
EXP-00008: ORACLE error 904 encountered ORA-00904: &amp;quot;POLTYP&amp;quot;: invalid identifier EXP-00000: Export terminated unsuccessfully  I eventually came across Oyvind Isene&amp;rsquo;s blog post which pointed out that you&amp;rsquo;d get this problem if you tried to export a 10g database using an 11g client which is exactly what I was trying to do!</description>

      <description>In my last post I showed how I&amp;rsquo;d been able to write a test around saved preferences in my app by making use of a ShadowPreferenceManager but it seemed a bit hacky.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to do that for every test where I dealt with preferences - I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be better if I could wrap the preferences in an object of my own and then inject it where necessary.</description>

The code that saved the preferences looked like this:
public class AuthoriseWithTwitterActivity extends RoboActivity { @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(intent); ... save(&amp;quot;fakeToken&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;fakeSecret&amp;quot;); ... } private void save(String userKey, String userSecret) { SharedPreferences settings = PreferenceManager.</description>

I made the stupid (in hindsight) mistake of not realising that I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing a lot of logic in BroadcastReceiver.onReceive since that bit of code gets executed on the UI thread.</description>

Am I actually learning anything? A thought I had many times in 2011 was &#39;am I actually learning anything?&#39; as, although I was working with languages that I hadn&#39;t used professionally before, the applications that we I worked on were very similar to ones that I&#39;ve worked on previously.</description>

The last time I tried to authenticate using OAuth a couple of years ago was a bit of a failure but luckily this time Honza Pokorny has written a blog post explaining what to do.
I had to adjust the code a little bit from what&amp;rsquo;s written on his post so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d document what I&amp;rsquo;ve done.</description>

 Why did the auditor like what I said? Because I explained everything we did in terms of risk. When they asked for a “process”, I explained the risk the process was meant to address. I then explained how our different process addressed the risk more effectively.</description>

      <description>One thing I wanted to do in the little application I&amp;rsquo;m working on was send data to other apps on my phone using the &amp;lsquo;share via&amp;rsquo; dialog which I&amp;rsquo;ve seen used on the Twitter app.
In this case I wanted to send a link and its title to twitter and came across a StackOverflow post which explained how to do so.
To keep it simple I added a button to the view and then shared the data via the on click event on that button:</description>

      <description>In the last week or so before Christmas I got the chance to spend some time pairing with my colleague Alex Harin while trying to understand how an existing application which we were investigating was written.
We knew from watching a demo of the application that the user was able to send some processing off to be done in the background and that they would be emailed once that had happened.</description>

      <title>Learning Android: WebView character encoding</title>

      <description>In my continued attempts to learn how to write an Android application I came across a problem with character encoding when trying to load some text into a WebView.
I was initially trying to write the text to the WebView like this:
WebView webview = new WebView(collection.getContext()); webview.loadData(textWithQuotesIn, &amp;quot;text/html&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;);   But ended up with the output in the picture on the left hand side. I tried playing around with the encoding and debugged the application all the way through until it hit the WebView but there didn&#39;t seem to be any problem with the text.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around a little bit with goose - a HTML content/article extractor - originally in Java but later in clojure where I needed to work out how to include goose and all its dependencies via Leiningen.
goose isn&amp;rsquo;t included in a Maven repository so I needed to create a local repository, something which I&amp;rsquo;ve got stuck on in the past.
Luckily Paul Gross has written a cool blog post explaining how his team got past this problem.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around a little bit today with writing an Android application and while for the majority of the time I&amp;rsquo;ve been deploying to an emulator I wanted to see what it&amp;rsquo;d look like on my phone.
The developer guide contains all the instructions on how to do this but unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;m blessed with the ability to skim over instructions which meant that my phone wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting picked up by the Android Debug Bridge.</description>

      <description>On a reasonable number of the systems that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on over the past few years there&amp;rsquo;s been a &amp;lsquo;black box&amp;rsquo; component which the team I&amp;rsquo;ve been on has needed to integrate with.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always found it a little strange that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to/want to know how that part of the system worked or that you could actually believe that it was truly a black box.
If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work then you have no way of diagnosing the problem - did you do something wrong, was there something wrong inside the black box or was it something else.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d heard about The Lean Startup for a long time before I actually read it, mainly from following the &amp;lsquo;Startup Lessons Learned&amp;rsquo; blog, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get the book until a colleague suggested a meetup to discuss how we might apply the ideas on our projects.
My general learning from the book is that we need to take the idea of creating tight feedback loops, which we&amp;rsquo;ve learnt in the agile/lean worlds, and apply it to product development.</description>

      <description>Another thing we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing with WebDriver is having it run with the FirefoxDriver while redirecting the display output into the Xvfb framebuffer so that we can run it on our continuous integration agents which don&amp;rsquo;t have a display attached.
The first thing we needed to do was set the environment property &amp;lsquo;webdriver.firefox.bin&amp;rsquo; to our own script which would point the display to Xvfb before starting Firefox:
import java.lang.System._ lazy val firefoxDriver: FirefoxDriver = { setProperty(&amp;quot;webdriver.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in an earlier post about removing manual test scenarios we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to automate some parts of our application where a user action leads to a jQuery ColorBox powered overlay appearing.
With this type of feature there tends to be some sort of animation which accompanies the overlay so we have to wait for an element inside the overlay to become visible on the screen before trying to do any assertions on the overlay.</description>

      <description>At XP Day I was chatting to Benjamin Mitchell about the 5 whys exercises that we&amp;rsquo;d tried on my team and I suggested that beyond Eric Ries&amp;rsquo; post on the subject I hadn&amp;rsquo;t come across an article/video which explained how to do it.
Benjamin mentioned that Douglas Squirrel had recently done a talk on this very subject at Skillsmatter and as with most Skillsmatter talks there&amp;rsquo;s a video of the presentation online.</description>

One of the (perhaps obvious) things that we&amp;rsquo;ve had to do as a result of wanting to do this is reduce the number of manual scenarios that our QAs need to run through.</description>

The team members who were there right at the beginning of the project 3 months earlier had come up with what they thought the proposed benefits/drawbacks would be so it was quite interesting to look at our thoughts at both times.</description>

      <description>Another session that I attended at XP Day was one facilitated by Steve Freeman and Joseph Pelrine where we discussed the Cynefin model, something that I first came across earlier in the year at XP 2011.
 We spent the first part of the session drawing out the model and coming up with some software examples which might fit into each domain.
 Simple - when you&#39;re going to checkin run the build Complicated - certain types of architectural decisions Complex - task estimation Chaos - startup explosion  Steve pointed out that with simple/complicated the important thing to remember is that things on the right hand side are repeatable whereas on the other side we could do the same thing again and get a completely different result.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on a Scala project for the last 6 months and previously given a couple of talks about adopting a functional style of programming in C# so this is a subject area that I find quite interesting.
The talk focused on 5 refactorings that the presenters have identified to help move imperative code to a more functional style:</description>

As a result we delegate from Scala code to the system unzip command like so:
def extract { var command = &amp;quot;unzip %s -d %s&amp;quot; format(&amp;quot;/file/to/unzip.zip&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;/place/to/unzip/to&amp;quot;) var process: Process = null try { process = Runtime.getRuntime.exec(command) val exitCode = process.</description>

Towards the end of the post he suggests joining Toastmasters as a useful first step for getting used to speaking to a group of people and as an added bonus you get feedback after each speech you give.</description>

When we wanted to get rid of an element we replaced that element with a SpecialNode:
val emptyNode = new scala.xml.SpecialNode() { def buildString(sb:StringBuilder) = new StringBuilder() def label = null }  Unfortunately when you call #text on the node it results in the following exception which we only found out today:</description>

      <description>We had a problem to solve earlier in the week where we wanted to try and find out which files we had ingested into our database based on a unique identifier.
We had a few hundred thousand files to search through to try and find the ones where around 50,000 identifiers were mentioned so that we could re-ingest them.
Running a normal grep for each identifier individually took a ridiculously long time so we needed to find a way to search for all of the identifiers at the same time to speed up the process.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I wrote about a problem we&amp;rsquo;ve been having with trying to work out how to default a function parameter that we have in one of our methods.
Our current version of the code defines the function parameter as implicit which means that if it isn&amp;rsquo;t passed in it defaults to Predef.conforms():
def foo[T](bar: String)(implicit blah:(String =&amp;gt; T)) = { println(blah(bar)); bar }  It&amp;rsquo;s not entirely clear just from reading the code where the implicit value is coming from so we want to try and make the code a bit more expressive.</description>

      <description>Last week my colleague Pat created a method which had a parameter which he wanted to make optional so that consumers of the API wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to provide it if they didn&amp;rsquo;t want to.
We ended up making the method take in an implicit value such that the method signature looked a bit like this:
def foo[T](implicit blah:(String =&amp;gt; T)) = { println(blah(&amp;quot;mark&amp;quot;)) &amp;quot;foo&amp;quot; }  We can call foo with or without an argument:</description>

      <description>One cool thing about using Scala on my current project is that we don&amp;rsquo;t have nulls anywhere in our code, instead when something may or may not be there we make use of the Option type.
Unfortunately what we&amp;rsquo;ve (heavily contributed by me) ended up with in our code base is repeated use of the isDefined method whenever we want to make a decision depending on whether or not the option is populated.</description>

      <description>As part of the ingestion process for our application we import XML documents and corresponding PDFs into a database and onto the file system respectively.
 Since the user needs to be able to search for documents by the userFacingId we reference it by that identifier in the database and the web application.
Each document also has an external identifier and we use this to identify the PDFs on the file system.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year Liz Keogh gave a talk at QCon London titled &amp;lsquo;Learning and Perverse Incentives: The Evil Hat&amp;rsquo; where she eventually encouraged people to try and game the systems that they take part in.
Over the last month or so we&amp;rsquo;ve had two different metrics visibly on show and are therefore prime targets for being gamed.
The first metric is one we included on our build radiator which shows how many commits to the git repository each person has for that day.</description>

      <title>Scala: Adding logging around a repository</title>

      <description>We wanted to add some logging around one of our repositories to track how many times users were trying to do various things on the application and came across a cool blog post explaining how we might be able to do this.
We ended up with the following code:
class BarRepository { def all: Seq[Bar] = Seq() def find(barId:String) : Bar = Bar(&amp;quot;myBar&amp;quot;) }  class TrackService(barRepository:BarRepository) { def all : Seq[Bar] = { var bars = barRepository.</description>

      <title>Scala: Creating an Xml element with an optional attribute</title>

      <description>We have a lot of Xml in our application and one of the things that we need to do reasonably frequently in our test code is create elements which have optional attributes on them.
Our simple first approach looked like this:
def createElement(attribute: Option[String]) = if(attribute.isDefined) &amp;lt;p bar={attribute.get} /&amp;gt; else &amp;lt;p /&amp;gt;  That works but it always seemed like we should be able to do it in a simpler way.</description>

      <description>Last week my colleague Pat Fornasier ran our team&amp;rsquo;s fortnightly retrospective and one of the exercises we did was &amp;lsquo;the 5 whys&amp;rsquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to see how the 5 why&amp;rsquo;s would pan out but could never see how you could fit it into a normal retrospective.
Pat was able to do this by using the data gathered by an earlier timeline exercise where the team had to plot the main events that had happened over the last 6 months.</description>

      <description>I love playing around with commands on the Unix shell but one of the ones that I&amp;rsquo;ve found the most difficult to learn beyond the very basics is find.
I think this is partially because I find the find man page quite difficult to read and partially because it&amp;rsquo;s usually quicker to work out how to solve my problem with a command I already know than to learn another one.</description>

      <description>I came across an interesting set of posts by Jeff Wofford where he talks about programmers getting stuck and it made me think that, despite its faults, agile software development does have some useful practices for stopping us getting stuck for too long.
Many of the examples that Jeff describes sound like yak shaving to me which is part of what makes programming fun but doesn&amp;rsquo;t always correlate to adding value to the product that you&amp;rsquo;re building.</description>

      <description>Something that we want to do reasonable frequently on my current project is to push some changes which have been committed to our local repository to master but not all of them.
For example we might end up with 3 changes we haven&amp;rsquo;t pushed:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/github/local$ git status # On branch master # Your branch is ahead of &#39;origin/master&#39; by 3 commits. # nothing to commit (working directory clean)  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/github/local$ git hist * bb7b139 Thu, 20 Oct 2011 07:37:11 +0100 | mark: one last time (HEAD, master) [Mark Needham] * 1cef99a Thu, 20 Oct 2011 07:36:35 +0100 | mark:another new line [Mark Needham] * 850e105 Thu, 20 Oct 2011 07:36:01 +0100 | mark: new line [Mark Needham] * 2b25622 Thu, 20 Oct 2011 07:32:43 +0100 | mark: adding file for first time (origin/master) [Mark Needham]  And we only want to push the commit with hash 850e105 for example.</description>

      <description>On my current project we regularly use a few Unix tools which aren&amp;rsquo;t on the standard installation so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d collate them here so I don&amp;rsquo;t forget about them in the future.
ghex We suspected we&amp;rsquo;d ended up with some rogue characters in a file that we weren&amp;rsquo;t able to detect in our normal text editor recently and wanted to view the byte by byte representation of the file to check it out.</description>

      <description>A lot of the time when I&amp;rsquo;m using the bash shell I want to re-use commands that I&amp;rsquo;ve previously entered and I&amp;rsquo;ve recently learnt some neat ways to do this from my colleagues Tom and Kief.
If we want to list the history of all the commands we&amp;rsquo;ve entered in a shell session then the following command does the trick:
&amp;gt; history ... 761 sudo port search pdfinfo 762 to_ipad andersen-phd-thesis.</description>

The PDFs we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with are linearized since they&amp;rsquo;re available for viewing on the web:
 A LINEARIZED PDF FILE is one that has been organized in a special way to enable efﬁcient incremental access in a network environment.</description>

      <description>We recently wanted to get the Git history of a file which we knew existed but had now been deleted so we could find out what had happened to it.
Using a simple git log didn&amp;rsquo;t work:
git log deletedFile.txt fatal: ambiguous argument &#39;deletedFile.txt&#39;: unknown revision or path not in the working tree. ~~~	We eventually came across &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/2010/07/querying-deleted-content-in-git.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Francois Marier&#39;s blog post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; which points out that you need to use the following command instead: ~~~text git log -- deletedFile.</description>

      <description>We recently wanted to replace a trait mixed into one of our classes with a fake version to make it easier to test but forgot how exactly to do that!
The class is roughly like this:
trait Foo { def foo : String = &amp;quot;real foo&amp;quot; } class Mark extends Foo {}  We originally tried to replace it like this:
trait BrokenFakeFoo { def foo : String = &amp;quot;broken fake foo&amp;quot; } val m = new Mark with BrokenFakeFoo  error: overriding method foo in trait Foo of type =&amp;gt; String; method foo in trait BrokenFakeFoo of type =&amp;gt; String needs `override&#39; modifier val m = new Mark with BrokenFakeFoo  If m compiled it would have two versions of foo but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know which one to use, hence the error message.</description>

      <description>Liz and I recently spent some time building a pair stair to show how long ago people had paired with each other and one of the things we had to do was make AJAX requests to get the pairing data for each person and then collate it all to build the stair.
 The original attempt to do this looked a bit like this:
var people = [&amp;quot;Marc&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Liz&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ken&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Duncan&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Uday&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Mark&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Charles&amp;quot;]; var grid = []; $.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve attended a lot of different retrospectives over the last few years and one thing that seems to happen quite frequently is that a problem will be raised and there will become a massive urgency to find an action to match with that problem.
As a result of this we don&amp;rsquo;t tend to go very deeply into working out why that problem happened in the first place and how we can stop it happening in the first place.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with some node.js code to get each of the commits from our git repository but noticed that it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be returning me all the results.
I had the following code:
var exec = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).exec; var gitRepository = &#39;/some/local/path&#39;; exec(&#39;cd &#39; + gitRepository + &#39; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git log --pretty=format:&amp;quot;%H | %ad | %s%d&amp;quot; --date=raw &#39;, function(error, stdout, stderror) { var commits = stdout.split(&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;); // do some stuff with commits });  We have around 2000 commits in the repository but I was only getting back 1600 of them when I checked the length of commits.</description>

Every now and then we take what&amp;rsquo;s on the wall and prioritise it according to Fabio Pereira&amp;rsquo;s effort/pain matrix so that we know which clean up tasks will provide the greatest value to the team.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve generally avoided using for expressions in Scala because the keyword reminds me of for loops in Java/C# and I want to learn to program in a less imperative way.
After working with my colleague Mushtaq I realised that in some cases using for comprehensions can lead to much more readable code.
An interesting use case where this is the case is when we want to create an object from a bunch of parameters that may or may not be set.</description>

      <description>We make use of the Javascript trim() function in our application but didn&amp;rsquo;t realise that it isn&amp;rsquo;t implemented by Internet Explorer until version 9.
This led to the following error on IE8 when we used it:
 Message: Object doesn&#39;t support this property or method Line: 18 Char: 13 Code: 0 URI: http://our.app/file.js  There&amp;rsquo;s a stackoverflow thread suggesting some different ways of implementing your own &amp;lsquo;trim()&amp;rsquo; method but since we&amp;rsquo;re using jQuery already we decided to just use the &amp;lsquo;$.</description>

I needed a way to extract a story number from the git commit message and then store them all in a text file.
A typical commit with a story number in might look like this:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with node.js to generate some graphs from our git repository which effectively meant chaining together a bunch of shell commands to give me the repository data in the format I wanted.
I was able to do this by making use of child_process which comes with the core library.
The first version looked like this:
var exec = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).exec, _ = require(&amp;quot;underscore&amp;quot;); ... function parseCommitsFromRepository(fn) { var gitRepository = &amp;quot;/tmp/core&amp;quot;; var gitPlayArea = &amp;quot;/tmp/&amp;quot; + new Date().</description>

On the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on we all commit as the same user and then put our names at the beginning of the commit message.
We wanted to try and find out the statistics of who&amp;rsquo;d been pairing with each other and therefore needed to extract the pairs from commits.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written a lot of blog posts in the past about pair programming and the advantages that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen from using this technique but lately I find myself increasingly frustrated at the need to pair 100% of the time which happens on most teams I work on.
From my experience it&amp;rsquo;s certainly useful as a coaching tool, as I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before I think it&amp;rsquo;s a very useful for increasing the amount of collaboration between team members and an excellent way for ensuring that knowledge of the code base is spread across the team.</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time today trying to put together a quick script which would allow me to grab story numbers from the commits in our Git repository and then work out which functional areas those stories were in by querying mingle.
Therefore I wanted to make a curl request to the mingle and then pipe that result somewhere and run an xpath expression to get my element.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to write code in another script file and then reference that file from the shell and in my search to achieve that I came across XMLStarlet on stackoverflow.</description>

      <description>I recently worked on adding the meta data section for each of the different document types that it serves which involved showing 15-20 pieces of data for each document type.
There are around 4-5 document types and although the meta data for each document type is similar it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the same!
When we got to the second document type it wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious where the abstraction was so we went for the copy/paste approach to see if it would be any easier to see the commonality if we put the two templates side by side.</description>

      <description>The last couple of applications I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on have had almost completely read only databases where we had to populate the database in an offline process and then provide various ways for users to access the data.
This creates an interesting situation with respect to how we should setup our development environment.
Our normal setup would probably have an individual version of that database on every development machine and we would populate and then truncate the database during various test scenarios.</description>

      <description>My colleague Pat Fornasier has been using an interesting spin on the idea of making decisions at the last responsible moment by encouraging our team to &amp;lsquo;feel the pain&amp;rsquo; before introducing any constraint in our application.
These are some of the decisions which we&amp;rsquo;ve been delaying/are still delaying:
Dependency Injection Everyone in our team comes from a Java/C# background and one of the first technical decisions that gets made on applications in those languages is which dependency injection container to use.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with node.js again and one thing that I wanted to do was take a CSV file generated by the Go API and extract the build times so that we could display it on a graph.
Since I don&amp;rsquo;t have a Go instance on my machine I created a URL in my node application which would mimic the API and return a CSV file.
I&amp;rsquo;m using the express web framework to take care of some of the plumbing:</description>

      <description>A couple of colleagues and I were having an interesting discussion this afternoon about the visibility of functions which are mixed into an object from a trait.
The trait in question looks like this:
trait Formatting { def formatBytes(bytes: Long): Long = { math.round(bytes.toDouble / 1024) } }  And is mixed into various objects which need to display the size of a file in kB like this:
class SomeObject extends Formatting { }  By mixing that function into SomeObject any of the clients of SomeObject would now to be able to call that function and transform a bytes value of their own!</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re using WebDriver on my project to automate our functional tests and as a result are using the Page Object pattern to encapsulate each page of the application in our tests.
We&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to work out how to effectively reuse code since some of the pages have parts of them which work exactly the same as another page.
For example we had a test similar to this&amp;hellip;
class FooPageTests extends Spec with ShouldMatchers with FooPageSteps { it(&amp;quot;is my dummy test&amp;quot;) { .</description>

      <description>Most of the work that I&amp;rsquo;ve done with Clojure has involved running a bunch of functions directly in the REPL or through Leiningen&amp;rsquo;s run target which led to me getting caught out when I created a JAR and tried to run that.
As I mentioned a few weeks ago I&amp;rsquo;ve been rewriting part of our system in Clojure to see how the design would differ and a couple of levels down the Clojure version comprises of applying a map function over a collection of documents.</description>

      <description>One of the interesting problems that we have to solve on my current project is working out how to import a few million XML documents into our database in a reasonable amount of time.
The stages of the import process are as follows:
 Extract a bunch of ZIP files to the disc Processing only the XML documents... Load the XML document and determine whether the document is valid to import Add some meta data to the document for database indexing Import the document into the database  We&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this quite a bit recently and one of the main things we&amp;rsquo;ve learnt is the value of gathering detailing information about what&amp;rsquo;s actually happening in the code.</description>

We end up with a log file peppered with different statements which looks a bit like the following:

      <description>We were doing a bit of profiling of a data importing process we&amp;rsquo;ve been running across various environments and wanted to check whether or not one of the environments was a physical machine or a VM.
A bit of googling first led me to the following site where you can fill a MAC address and it will tell you which vendor it belongs to.
macvendorlookup.com is even better though because it&amp;rsquo;s more easily scriptable!</description>

      <description>We have several different test builders in our code base which look roughly like this:
case class FooBuilder(bar : String, baz : String) { def build = new Foo(bar, baz) }  In our tests we originally used them like this:
class FooPageTest extends Specs with ShouldMatchers { it(&amp;quot;should let us load a foo&amp;quot;) { when(databaseHas(FooBuilder(bar = &amp;quot;Bar&amp;quot;, baz = &amp;quot;Bazz&amp;quot;))) // and so on... } }  This works well but we wanted our tests to only contain domain language and no implementation details.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago I attended Michael Feathers&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Brutal Refactoring&amp;rsquo; workshop at XP 2011 where he opined that developers generally do the easiest thing when it comes to code bases.
More often than not this means adding to an existing method or existing class rather than finding the correct place to put the behaviour that they want to add.
Something interesting that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed so far on the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on is that so far we haven&amp;rsquo;t been seeing the same trend.</description>

      <description>One of the language features available to us in Scala which I think is having a big impact in helping us to make our code base easier to follow is the companion object.
We&amp;rsquo;ve been using companion objects quite liberally in our code base to define factory methods for our classes.
As I mentioned in a previous post a lot of our objects are acting as wrappers around XML documents and we&amp;rsquo;ve been pushing some of the data extraction from the XML into companion objects so that our classes can take in non XML values.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in an earlier post we&amp;rsquo;ve been parsing XML documents with the Clojure zip-filter API and the next thing we needed to do was create a new XML document containing elements which needed to be inside a namespace.
We wanted to end up with a document which looked something like this:
&amp;lt;root&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mynamespace:foo xmlns:mynamespace=&amp;quot;http://www.magicalurlfornamespace.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mynamespace:bar&amp;gt;baz&amp;lt;/mynamespace:bar&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/mynamespace:foo&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/root&amp;gt;  We can make use of lazy-xml/emit to output an XML string from some sort of input?</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been coding in Scala on my project for around 6 weeks now and are getting to the stage where we&amp;rsquo;re probably becoming a big dangerous with our desire to try out some of the language features.
One that we&amp;rsquo;re trying out at the moment is the implicit key word which allows you to pass arguments to objects and methods without explicitly defining them in the parameter list.
The website we&amp;rsquo;re working on needs to be accessible in multiple languages and therefore we need to be able to translate some words before they get displayed on the page.</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;ve started playing around with Clojure again I thought it&amp;rsquo;d make sense to use emacs as my editor and therefore needed to work out how to remap the Ctrl and Meta to keys which are more accessible on the MBP&amp;rsquo;s keyboard.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found that I like using the Caps Lock for Ctrl and that&amp;rsquo;s reasonably easy to change by navigating to &amp;lsquo;System Preferences &amp;gt; Keyboard &amp;gt; Modifier Keys&amp;rsquo;:
 The Meta key is Escape by default and I wanted to map it to the right Command key as that&amp;rsquo;s much easier for me to get to.</description>

Nurullah provides a neat zip-str function which we can use to convert an XML string into a zipper object:
(require &#39;[clojure.zip :as zip] &#39;[clojure.xml :as xml]) (use &#39;[clojure.contrib.zip-filter.xml]) (defn zip-str [s] (zip/xml-zip (xml/parse (java.io.ByteArrayInputStream. (.</description>

 Language as thought shaper: to induce a paradigm shift in how one should structure software (changing the &#34;path of least resistance&#34;).   To quote Alan Perlis: &#34;a language that doesn&#39;t affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.</description>

Our original thought was to pull it up into an abstract class which ended up looking like this:
abstract class SomeArbitraryClass(root:xml.Node) { def unrelatedField1:String def unrelatedField2:String def startPage:String def endPage:String def pageRange = if(firstPage == lastPage) &amp;quot;page %s&amp;quot;.format(firstPage) else &amp;quot;pages %s-%s&amp;quot;.format(firstPage, lastPage) }  Writing a test link to scala test for the page logic helped us to see more clearly that the design was a bit awkward:</description>

It was run by Iulian Dragos who wrote his Phd thesis on how to improve the performance of the Scala compiler.
The course was a bit adapted from the original in that it came at Scala more from an application developer&amp;rsquo;s point of view rather than that of a language geek.</description>

I had a collection of zip files and wanted to transform that into a collection of all the file entries in those files.
If we just use map then we&amp;rsquo;ll end up with a collection of collections which is more difficult to deal with going forward.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I tweeted that I didn&amp;rsquo;t really see the point in structured types in Scala&amp;hellip;
 Not sure I understand where you would use structural types in #scala instead of defining a method on a trait http://bit.ly/jgiW7b  &amp;hellip;but today my colleague Uday came up with a cool way of combining self type annotations with structured types inside a trait we defined.
We had some code duplicated across two classes which looked roughly like this:</description>

      <description>In &amp;lsquo;Thinking In Systems: A Primer&amp;rsquo; one of the most interesting ideas that Donella Meadows describes is what Herbert Simon coined &amp;lsquo;bounded rationality&amp;lsquo;:
 Bounded rationality means that people make quite reasonable decisions based on the information they have. But they don&#39;t have perfect information, especially about more distant parts of the system  Later on in the chapter the following idea is suggested:
 If you become a manager, you probably will stop seeing labour as a deserving partner in production, and start seeing it as a cost to be minimised.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, we&amp;rsquo;re making use of a MarkLogic database on the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on which means that we&amp;rsquo;re getting quite big XML data structures coming into our application whenever we execute a query.
The normal way that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen for dealing with external systems would be to create an anti corruption layer where we initialise objects in our system with the required data from the external system.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned a couple of months ago, while I was in India I was acting as the Tech Lead on the project the TWU grads were working on and one thing I learnt from doing that is the importance of trying to keep the passion of the developers on the team.
When we started off I was more focused on trying to encourage the team to try and develop as many of the stories as possible.</description>

      <title>Scala: val, lazy val and def</title>

      <description>We have a variety of val, lazy val and def definitions across our code base but have been led to believe that idiomatic Scala would have us using lazy val as frequently as possible.
As far as I understand so far this is what the different things do:
 val evaluates as soon as you initialise the object and stores the result. lazy val evaluates the first time that it&#39;s accessed and stores the result.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re using the Mustache templating engine on my project at the moment and one thing that we wanted to do was build a comma separated list.
Mustache is designed so that you pretty much can&amp;rsquo;t do any logic in the template which made it really difficult to do what we wanted.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy enough to get a comma after each item in a list with something like the following code:</description>

We started off with this:
search.xqy
xquery version &amp;quot;1.0-ml&amp;quot;; import module namespace search = &amp;quot;http://marklogic.com/appservices/search&amp;quot; at &amp;quot;/MarkLogic/appservices/search/search.xqy&amp;quot;; declare variable $term as xs:string := xdmp:get-request-field(&amp;quot;query&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;); search:search($term)  Which gives us back a list of results showing where in the documents the search term appeared.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re using the MarkLogic database on my current project and something that we wanted to do recently was delete all the documents as part of a deployment script.
Getting all of the documents is reasonably easy - we just need to make a call to the doc() function.
We can then iterate through the documents like so:
for $doc in doc() return $doc  We wanted to make use of the xdmp:document-delete function to tear down all of the modules but that needs a uri representing the location of the document in the database which isn&amp;rsquo;t available in $doc:</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re using Fedora on our local developer work stations and some of the default key bindings of the operating system seem to conflict with ones provided by IntelliJ IDEA.
One particular amusing one is &amp;lsquo;Ctrl-Alt-F7&amp;rsquo; which you use in IntelliJ to see the usages of a piece of code.
In Fedora that seems to switch into a different X Server session and you just see a blank screen with seemingly no way out!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a bit about Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s Law recently and its&amp;rsquo; applicability in software development.
Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s law is defined as follows:
 Parkinson&#39;s Law is the adage first articulated by Cyril Northcote Parkinson as the first sentence of a humorous essay published in The Economist in 1955: “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion”  My colleagues quite frequently reference this law with respect to stories taking the amount of time that reflects the story point estimate assigned to them.</description>

      <description>We wanted to try and generate a build label to use for the name of the artifacts archive that gets generated each time we run the build but wanted to default it to a hard coded value if the system property representing the build label wasn&amp;rsquo;t available.
In Ruby we would be able to do something like this:
buildLabel = ENV[&amp;quot;GO_PIPELINE_LABEL&amp;quot;] || &amp;quot;LOCAL&amp;quot;  There isn&amp;rsquo;t a function in Scala that does that so we initially ended up with this:</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in an earlier post we&amp;rsquo;re using SBT on our project and one of it&amp;rsquo;s cool features is that it will listen to the source directory and then automatically recompile the code when it detects file changes.
We&amp;rsquo;ve also installed the sbt-jetty-embed plugin which allows us to create a war which has Jetty embedded so that we can keep our application containerless.
That plugin adds an action called &amp;lsquo;jetty&amp;rsquo; to sbt so we (foolishly in hindsight) thought that we would be able to launch the application in triggered execution mode by making use of a ~ in front of that:</description>

We added them into &amp;lsquo;src/main/resources&amp;rsquo; and set that as a source path in IntelliJ assuming that was all we needed to do.
Despite doing that our test kept failing because it couldn&amp;rsquo;t locate the files on the classpath.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with this in the Scala REPL which we can launch with our project&amp;rsquo;s dependencies loaded with the following command:</description>

      <description>In her keynote at XP 2011 Esther Derby encouraged us to ask the question &amp;ldquo;in what world does that make sense?&amp;rdquo; whenever we encounter something which we consider to be stupid or ridiculous.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of it at the time but my colleague Pat Kua has been asking me the question whenever I&amp;rsquo;ve been describing something that I find confusing to him.
After about the third time I noticed that its quite a nice tool for getting us to reflect on the systems and feedback loops that may be encouraging the behaviour witnessed.</description>

      <description>In &amp;lsquo;Thinking In Systems&amp;rsquo; section five focuses on systems which produce &amp;ldquo;truly problematic behaviour&amp;rdquo; and one of these so called system traps is known as &amp;lsquo;rule beating&amp;rsquo;.
Rule beating occurs when the agents in a system take evasive action to get around the intent of rules in a system:  The letter of the law is met, the spirit of the law is not. 
A common system where we see this in organisations is around training budgets.</description>

Esther quoted Donella Meadows, the author of &amp;lsquo;Thinking in Systems&amp;rsquo;, a few times which was an interesting coincidence for me as I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading her book.
One of the first quotes from that book was the following:  The original purpose of a hierarchy is always to help its&amp;rsquo; originating subsystems do their job better</description>

      <description>One of the areas that I covered during a session I ran at XP 2011 on making feedback work in teams was the idea of giving feedback in public.
The general consensus seems to be that giving feedback in public isn&amp;rsquo;t a good idea and it&amp;rsquo;d much more effective to give that feedback privately.
I think this is a good rule of thumb and my observations are that feedback given in public tends to not be given in a very constructive manner and therefore leads to a defensive response from the recipient.</description>

For most of the time that I was there he drove out the design for a point of sale system in Java while showing how architectural patterns can emerge in the code just by focusing on improving names and removing duplication.

In the book Noonan runs through a series of different tools that Chris Argyris originally came up with for helping people to handle difficult conversational situations more effectively.
I really like the way the book is written.</description>

 Sometimes I challenge my students to try to think of any human decision that occurs without a feedback loop - that is, a decision that is made without regard to any information about the level of stock that it influences  Meadows has quite a nice way of guiding us to thinking about systems by referring to &amp;lsquo;stocks&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;flows&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>I recently came across Joseph Pelrine&amp;rsquo;s blog post where he describes the way that you might go about organising a great party.
He describes a party that a friend of his hosted and all the things which contributed to it being great, such as the people you invite, the music that is played, the food and drink that are served and the conversations that are had.
If you then wanted to replicate a &amp;lsquo;great party&amp;rsquo; you might think that you could just replay his friend&amp;rsquo;s party, with the same guests, same music, a script of the conversations had and so on.</description>

      <description>Since we finished the most recent ThoughtWorks University session last week a few people have been asking me how the experience was and I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself comparing this experience to my own as an attendee in August 2006.
Back then ThoughtWorks University was much different. We had 5 weeks of workshop style sessions and then spent the last week working on an internal application.
This time we spent 1 week doing the workshop style sessions, 1 week working together on a story and then 4 weeks working on the application.</description>

      <description>In Discussing the Undiscussable William Noonan describes the ladder of inference, a tool which can be used to help us achieve double loop learning with respect to our interactions with other people.
 Ladder of Inference helps people identify what information or facts are used as the basis for their reasoning process. It also helps people understand how they interpret that information and how they apply their interpretation to the issue or problem at hand.</description>

      <description>After six weeks ThoughtWorks University #21 finished on Thursday so I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be interesting to summarise some of the things that people seemed to find difficult over the course of TWU.
The stack trace We were using Java for the duration of TWU and as a result there were plenty of stack traces for people to debug.
These were most frequently related to incorrect wiring of Spring components but there were other reasons too.</description>

      <description>I recently came across David McRaney&amp;rsquo;s post about the sunk cost fallacy with reference to Farmville, a fallacy that is very applicable to software.
David starts off with the following statements which describe the fallacy pretty well:
 The Misconception: You make rational decisions based on the future value of objects, investments and experiences. The Truth: Your decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in an earlier post I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing the role of tech lead on the project that we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing at ThoughtWorks University so I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be interesting to note down some of my observations so far.
Out of the tech leads that I&amp;rsquo;ve had I liked the style of Dave Cameron the best.
He viewed himself more as a technical facilitator rather than as a person who should make every single decision about how a system got built which meant that others also got a chance to take some responsibility.</description>

      <description>One of the things that we&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with at ThoughtWorks University is giving the attendees the opportunity to run the project that we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.
The first few weeks were the most frustrating both for the trainers and for the attendees because we spent a lot of time telling the attendees that it was their project but then didn&amp;rsquo;t display behaviour consistent with that message.
From my observations this happened because the role of the trainers was defined as &amp;lsquo;senior team member&amp;rsquo; which meant that if a trainer saw something going wrong they&amp;rsquo;d try and fix it since that&amp;rsquo;s what they&amp;rsquo;d do in a normal team.</description>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2011/04/13/feedback-easing-in/</guid>
      <description>One of the most common techniques of feedback which I&amp;rsquo;ve come across is one that William Noonan describes in &amp;lsquo;Discussing the Undiscussable&amp;rsquo; as easing in.
From the book:  Easing in is a skilful strategy whereby I try to get the other person to come round to my point of view without my stating it directly. 
From my experience we&amp;rsquo;ll try to do this because giving our point of view could lead to an awkward conversation so we&amp;rsquo;d rather they express our opinion for us instead.</description>

      <description>Last week my colleague T.C. and I had to work out how to HTML encode the values entered by the user when redisplaying those onto the page to prevent a cross site scripting attack on the website.
I wrote a blog post a couple of years ago describing how to do this in ASP.NET MVC and the general idea is that we need to have a custom renderer which HTML encodes any strings that pass through it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading the final chapter of William Noonan&amp;rsquo;s Discussing the Undiscussable titled &amp;lsquo;Helping Those Who Teach, Learn&amp;rsquo; and a couple of the ideas that he describes seem quite applicable to what we&amp;rsquo;re doing at ThoughtWorks University.
Modelling the skills When teaching the Mutual Learning Model Noonan suggests that the practitioner needs to be able to produce actions consistent with the model in real time situations rather than just being able to do convincing presentations on the subject.</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time yesterday afternoon working out how to get the output from the Unix command &amp;lsquo;say&amp;rsquo; to be played whenever our build breaks.
We&amp;rsquo;re using cctray on a Windows box for that purpose which means that we need to have the file in the &amp;lsquo;wav&amp;rsquo; format.
Unfortunately &amp;lsquo;say&amp;rsquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be able to output a file in that format:

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been acting as the tech lead on the project that we&amp;rsquo;re working on at ThoughtWorks University and as a result I sometimes find myself being dragged away from my pair to help someone else.
An interesting thing which I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed on more than one occasion is that when I&amp;rsquo;ve come back from helping - maybe 15 or 20 minutes later - my pair has actually got much further than I expected them to.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in an earlier post Sumeet has been encouraging us to act more as coaches rather than trainers during ThoughtWorks University but it&amp;rsquo;s not quite as easy as it seems.
I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that there are a few things that contribute to this difficulty.
Assessment The biggest obstacle is that by the end of TWU the trainers are required to send a review about each of the grads to the respective Resource Managers describing each person&amp;rsquo;s current level of skill in various categories.</description>

      <description>When I attended ThoughtWorks University in August 2006 we spent quite a bit of time playing games which had been designed to help us to achieve various learning objectives.
At the time I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much about it but now being on the other side as a trainer I&amp;rsquo;ve started to doubt whether these types of sessions are as useful as I originally thought.
I recently came across a blog post Sumeet wrote last year where he talks about effective e-learning environments and I think his point still applies here:</description>

      <description>One of the most interesting things that I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about recently is the idea of single and double loop learning which were defined by Chris Argyris and Donald Schon in their book &amp;lsquo;Organizational Learning: A theory of action perspective&amp;rsquo; in 1978.
 I quite like the definitions that Mark Smith gives for these types of learning in his article about Chris Argyris:
Single Loop Learning  Single-loop learning seems to be present when goals, values, frameworks and, to a significant extent, strategies are taken for granted.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote about the coding dojo style week that we ran at ThoughtWorks University last week and I briefly mentioned that we used break out sessions to cover topics (&amp;lsquo;the pearls&amp;rsquo;) that people didn&amp;rsquo;t totally understand.
To describe that in more detail what we did to start with was write the name of each of the 90&amp;frasl;180 minute sessions on a card and put it on the wall under a &amp;lsquo;To Do&amp;rsquo; heading:</description>

      <description>One of the aspects of software development that I&amp;rsquo;ve thankfully seen relatively infrequently over the last few years is that of some people in teams working long hours on a consistent basis.
I have seen it happen on a few occasions and I think it can have a detrimental effect on a team rather than the good which is presumably intended.
The biggest disadvantage is that it makes other people in the team feel guilty that they aren&amp;rsquo;t working long hours and they may feel peer pressured into matching the hours of their colleagues.</description>

      <description>One of the things that Sumeet has been encouraging at ThoughtWorks University is the idea that the &amp;lsquo;trainers&amp;rsquo; should be in a coaching role rather than a training one.
As a result of this suggestion one of the things we&amp;rsquo;ve done is to change the style of the second week so that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t full of sessions/workshops but instead involved working on code as a group.
Jim came up with the idea of the &amp;lsquo;exploded story&amp;rsquo; whereby we spent the whole of last week as a group working on one story for Sukrupa while spending quite a bit of time exploring the different activities that playing a story end to end would involve.</description>

      <description>We ran a refactoring dojo a couple of days ago at ThoughtWorks University and in preparation I wrote some system level tests around the coding problem that we were going to use during the session.
It&amp;rsquo;s a command line application which is called through the main method of &amp;lsquo;Program&amp;rsquo; and since there&amp;rsquo;s no dependency injection we need to be able to set System.in and System.out in order to do any testing.</description>

      <description>One of the things that I&amp;rsquo;m learning while working at ThoughtWorks University is to bite my tongue a bit to allow people to learn in their own way.
I noticed this particularly yesterday in a refactoring session we were doing.
For about 10-15 minutes in the middle of the session we&amp;rsquo;d managed to get the code into a state where it didn&amp;rsquo;t compile and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t run the tests.
The &amp;lsquo;natural&amp;rsquo; inclination in that situation for me would be to step in and impart some &amp;lsquo;wisdom&amp;rsquo; about the importance of taking small steps while refactoring.</description>

      <description>I facilitated a refactoring session today at ThoughtWorks University where we spent the morning refactoring our way through one of the problems the grads had to work on as part of the pre coursework.
The previous version of this session has been more structured, whereby one of the trainers worked solo at the keyboard and took suggestions from the group about which refactoring to cover next.
There are a certain number of refactorings that the session aims to introduce and the trainer would have practiced beforehand so they could make these fairly flawlessly.</description>

      <description>One of the approaches that I like the best in retrospectives is when the facilitator splits the team into smaller groups during the brainstorming part of the retrospective.
I decided to try this out in a retrospective we ran after one week of ThoughtWorks University, using The Retrospective Starfish to provide a framework in which people could frame their thoughts.
Usually what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen happen in these mini groups is that everyone will write down their own ideas on stickies and then discuss them as a group but still put up all the stickies even if the group didn&amp;rsquo;t agree with everything.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned confirmation bias in a few of my previous blog posts but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t realised quite how widespread it can be in organisations until quite recently.
Confirmation bias  [A] tendency for people to favor information that confirms their preconceptions or hypotheses regardless of whether the information is true.
As a result, people gather evidence and recall information from memory selectively, and interpret it in a biased way.
The biases appear in particular for emotionally significant issues and for established beliefs.</description>

      <description>Over the last year or so I&amp;rsquo;ve had some opportunities to pair with a few different people on sessions/presentations that we&amp;rsquo;ve been giving.
I much prefer doing this than presenting something by myself mainly because it&amp;rsquo;s much more fun and seems to encourage more participation than when I do something alone.
I feel that it&amp;rsquo;s probably easier to pair present if you both have similar opinions on the subject matter and are comfortable with a similar style of delivery.</description>

Sumeet suggested that the word &amp;lsquo;intuitive&amp;rsquo; is quite overloaded and later pointed me to an article on the Moodle website which advocates the same thing:
 Intuitive is a word you should avoid in discussions of usability as its meaning is often confused.</description>

      <description>For as long as I can remember I&amp;rsquo;ve had the belief that, at least as far as software is concerned, everything I know how to do everyone else also knows how to do.
I carried that assumption for quite a while and only realised relatively recently how harmful it can be.
The most observable outcome I noticed is that I either didn&amp;rsquo;t give my opinion in group situations or just didn&amp;rsquo;t take part in them because I assumed that what I wanted to say would eventually be contributed by someone else anyway.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a fair percentage of the last couple of weeks preparing sessions for ThoughtWorks University and one thing Frankie has been trying to encourage is only preparing one at a time i.e. limited work in progress
Normally I&amp;rsquo;d be completely in favour of that approach but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work at all for me with this type of work.
There seem to be a few parts to creating a session, including:</description>

      <description>My colleague Jason Yip recently linked to the Kano Model and although it&amp;rsquo;s a theory about product development the definition of what counts as a product seems like it can be quite broad.
The best explanation of the model that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across so far is a post by Jean Claude Grosjean which Frankie linked me to.
Grosjean describes the three types of requirements like so:
Must Have (&amp;ldquo;Basic needs&amp;rdquo;) These are not always expressed but they are obvious to the customer and must be met&amp;hellip;[they] are not a source of satisfaction but can cause major disappointment.</description>

      <description>It recently struck me while preparing some ThoughtWorks University sessions that there appear to be two modes that I spend my time switching between while coding:
 Action mode - we&#39;re focused on getting things done, making things happen Reflective mode - we&#39;re a bit more detached and looking at things from a higher level  I spent the majority of 2008 and 2009 in reflective mode on the systems I was working on which can be seen by scanning through a lot of the blog posts that I wrote during that time.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been spending our time recently preparing the sessions for the next ThoughtWorks University batch and one thing Sumeet has encouraged us to do is ensure that we have a measurable goal for each session.
In our case that means that we need to design our sessions with the intention of the grads being able to do something rather than understand something after the session.
It&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to measure whether someone understands something and from what I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed having a goal of someone understanding something can encourage you to put in more than is strictly necessary.</description>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2011/02/27/ruby-refactoring-from-hash-to-object/</guid>
      <description>Something I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed when I play around with Ruby in my own time is that I nearly always end up with the situation where I&amp;rsquo;m passing hashes all over my code and to start with it&amp;rsquo;s not a big deal.
Unfortunately I eventually get to the stage where I&amp;rsquo;m effectively modelling an object inside a hash and it all gets very difficult to understand.
I&amp;rsquo;ve written a few times before about incrementally refactoring code so this seemed like a pretty good chance for me to try that out.</description>

      <description>Another interesting pair programming &amp;lsquo;technique&amp;rsquo; which I rediscovered while pairing with Priyank is that of doodling or drawing various parts of the solution when your pair is writing code. I find that this helps to stop my brain wondering off and lets me reflect on what we&amp;rsquo;re doing from a higher level.
As an added bonus it also seems to allow me to listen more effectively to my pair.
From what I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed it works most effectively when the other person is reasonably comfortable with the code base and language which was certainly the case when I was pairing with Priyank.</description>

      <description>The first time I came across the Pecha Kucha style of presenting was at the XP 2010 conference during the Agile Suitcase session where Pat Kua and some others talked about the practices, principles and values they most favoured.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never done one before but as part of the preparation work for ThoughtWorks University each of the trainers had to prepare one which we then presented to each other yesterday.</description>

      <description>Something which I frequently forget while reading books is that it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite useful to know exactly why you&amp;rsquo;re reading it i.e. what knowledge are you trying to gain by doing so.
I noticed this again recently while reading The Agile Samurai - it&amp;rsquo;s one of the books we ask ThoughtWorks University participants to read before they come to India.
Implicitly I knew that I just wanted to get a rough idea of what sort of things it&amp;rsquo;s telling people but I somewhat foolishly just started reading it cover to cover.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed recently that while pairing with various different people that I frequently ask my pair what they&amp;rsquo;re trying to learn through the approach that they&amp;rsquo;re about to take.
I tend to use it when I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand what my pair is doing and want to find out so that I can stay engaged.
It seems to be a more effective and less confrontational way of finding out than saying &amp;ldquo;What are you doing?</description>

      <description>Earlier in the year I wrote about Chris Argyris&amp;rsquo; espoused theory and theory in action and one of the interesting aspects to it which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t previously considered is how we treat people when their espoused theory and theory in action don&amp;rsquo;t match.
My tendency is to think that these people are hypocrites but Benjamin Mitchell pointed out in a conversation on twitter that it&amp;rsquo;s not really helpful to think that way:</description>

      <description>I learnt about the pomodoro technique a couple of years ago and while I did try it out sporadically back then, it&amp;rsquo;s only recently that I thought I&amp;rsquo;d properly give it a try when managing my spare time.
My approach without the pomodoro technique is to have a long list of things that I could do and then not really doing any of them because I feel bad about not doing one of the other things instead.</description>

      <description>I realised a couple of weeks ago while pairing with a colleague that I&amp;rsquo;ve become quite bad at interrupting people while they&amp;rsquo;re speaking.
I did have an inkling that I&amp;rsquo;d let my ability to properly listen to someone drift a bit but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen any evidence until my colleague pointed it out.
Somewhat ironically I actually wrote a post about active listening when I first started working at ThoughtWorks in 2006 and reading back over the listening barriers that I listed I realise that there are a few that I tend to break:</description>

      <description>6 months after my first attempt to train one of the ThoughtWorks University batches was cut short I&amp;rsquo;m back in Bangalore again and spent the first few days of this week pairing with the grads.
It&amp;rsquo;s been interesting for me trying to balance how much I help and suggest ideas while still allowing them to learn at the same time.
At the moment I think I&amp;rsquo;m leaning too far towards helping and not realising until later on that my colleague hadn&amp;rsquo;t quite understood why I&amp;rsquo;d suggested what I did and therefore hadn&amp;rsquo;t learnt anything from my suggestion.</description>

      <description>After a few recent conversations with colleagues as well as my observations of several projects I&amp;rsquo;m coming to the conclusion that the way that people react in situations often differs significantly depending on whether they&amp;rsquo;re working in a large or small team.
One of the most obvious ways that this manifests itself is when there comes a need for someone to volunteer to take care of something - be it a particular functional area, communication with the onshore team or something else.</description>

We can access the system clipboard via the &amp;lsquo;+&amp;rsquo; buffer so the commands revolve around that.

I recently came across a problem which I struggled to solve for quite a while.
Based on the following map function:

      <description>Irfan and I were looking at how to do some text substitution in a text file this afternoon and turned to sed to help us in our quest.
He had originally used grep to find what he wanted to replace on each line, using a grep regular expression to match one or more numbers:
cat the_file.txt | grep &amp;quot;[0-9]\+&amp;quot;  That works pretty well but since I knew how to do the substitution in sed we needed to convert the regular expression to work with sed.</description>

I wanted to note them down so that I&amp;rsquo;m more aware that these might be common areas to improve on for university graduates that I work with in the future.
Naming of things I don&amp;rsquo;t remember there being that much focus on naming variables/methods/classes in any of the programming courses that I studied.</description>

The most popular way is to ask for general feedback which answers questions like this:  What are the things that the individual has done well? What are the things that the individual has not done well and/or needs more focus/improvement?</description>

We can find out if items are out of stock by making a call to an external service:</description>

      <description>Something which I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed recently in particular when interviewing people but also in some other situations is that frequently posing a question which begins with &amp;lsquo;why&amp;rsquo; results in quite a defensive response.
While discussing this with Priyank he pointed out that asking a question in this way can often be construed as a criticism of the idea being questioned.
Admittedly it is often the case that I&amp;rsquo;m questioning something which has been done differently than what I might have done but I&amp;rsquo;m still curious as to the reasoning behind it.</description>

      <description>Although the majority of the teams that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on over the past few years have been relatively small in size I have worked on a few where the team size has been pretty big and perhaps inevitably the productivity has felt much lower.
I think this is somewhat inevitable since although the overall throughput of these teams may be higher than on smaller teams, due to problems such as having difficulty parallelising work, not every pair is working at maximum productivity.</description>

      <description>While trawling the comments of Dan North&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Deliberate Discovery&amp;rsquo; post I came across an interesting article written by Phillip G. Armour titled &amp;lsquo;The Five Orders of Ignorance&amp;rsquo;.
The main thing I took from the article is that the author uses the metaphor of software as a &amp;lsquo;knowledge acquisition activity&amp;rsquo; for which he then defines five orders of ignorance that we can have in our attempts to acquire that knowledge.
These are as follows:</description>

      <description>Towards the end of Dan North&amp;rsquo;s post on Deliberate Discovery he makes the following suggestion:
 There is much more to say about deliberate discovery. Think about applying the principle to learning a new language, or picking up a new technology, or a new domain. What could you do to identify and reduce your ignorance most rapidly?  This reminded me a lot of what I used to do when I came across things that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to do a few years ago.</description>

      <description>I was recently reading an article about how to write meaningful user stories and towards the end of it the author mentioned the INVEST acronym which suggests that stories should be:
 Independent Negotiable Valuable Estimable Small Testable  From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the most difficult one to achieve in a distributed context is that stories should be &amp;lsquo;negotiable&amp;rsquo;, in particular when it comes to negotiating the way that the UX of a bit of functionality should work.</description>

      <description>One of the things that has been puzzling me during my time in India is the amount of time that is spent in meetings pushing information to people rather than them pulling it.
In previous projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on a lot of the knowledge was moved between around as a result of osmotic communication
 Osmotic communication means that information flows into the background hearing of members of the team, so that they pick up relevant information as though by osmosis.</description>

      <description>In Growing Object Oriented Software the authors talk about the value of listening to our tests to understand potential problems with our code and I&amp;rsquo;ve started to notice recently that there are implicit feedback mechanisms dotted around at a higher level which we can also listen to.
A couple of examples come to mind:
Nothing to show in the showcase I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on a couple of projects where we&amp;rsquo;ve got to the end of the iteration and realised that we don&amp;rsquo;t actually have anything tangible to show the product owner.</description>

      <description>While reading Dan North&amp;rsquo;s second post about software craftsmanship I was able to resonate quite a lot with a point he made in the &amp;lsquo;On value&amp;rsquo; section:
 I’m not going to mandate test-driving anything (which is a huge about-face from what I was saying a year ago), unless it will help. Copy-and-paste is fine too. (Before you go all shouty at me again, hold off until I blog about the benefits of copy-and-paste, as it appears in a couple of patterns I’m calling Spike and Stabilize and Ginger Cake.</description>

 mysql5 Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.1.48, for apple-darwin10.4.0 (i386) using readline 6.1  When I try to use the &amp;lsquo;LOAD DATA LOCAL&amp;rsquo; option to load data into tables I get the following error message:

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with mounting a Windows file share onto my machine via the terminal because I&amp;rsquo;m getting bored of constantly having to go to Finder and manually mounting it each time!
After a couple of times of mounting and unmounting the drive I ended up with this error:
&amp;gt; mount_smbfs //mneedham@punedc02/shared punedc02_shared/ mount_smbfs: mount error: /Volumes/punedc02_shared: File exists  I originally thought the &amp;lsquo;file exists&amp;rsquo; part of the message was suggesting that I&amp;rsquo;d already mounted a share on &amp;lsquo;punedc02_shared&amp;rsquo; but calling the &amp;lsquo;umount&amp;rsquo; command led to the following error:</description>

      <description>A few days ago I wrote about how we&amp;rsquo;d been using Sed to edit multiple files and while those examples were derived from what we&amp;rsquo;d been using on Ubuntu I realised that they didn&amp;rsquo;t actually work on Mac OS X.
For example, the following command:
sed -i &#39;s/require/include/&#39; Rakefile  Throws this error:
sed: 1: &amp;quot;Rakefile&amp;quot;: invalid command code R  What I hadn&amp;rsquo;t realised is that on the Mac version of sed the &amp;lsquo;-i&amp;rsquo; flag has a mandatory suffix, as described in this post.</description>

      <description>Via some combination of Christian Blunden, Pat Kua, David Joyce and Benjamin Mitchell I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending some time lately reading about the work of Chris Argyris.
I&amp;rsquo;ve previously come across his name while reading The Fifth Discipline but I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise how interesting his work actually is.
One of the interesting concepts I&amp;rsquo;ve come across so far is the difference between espoused theory and theory in use:
Espoused theory  The world view and values people believe their behaviour is based on.</description>

      <description>For about an hour or so this afternoon we were following the somewhat evil practice of using a method defined in a helper inside a controller.
The method was defined in the ApplicationHelper module:
module ApplicationHelper def foo # do something end end  So we initially assumed that we&amp;rsquo;d just be able to reference that method inside any of our controllers since they all derive from ApplicationController.
That wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case so our next attempt was to try and add it as a helper:</description>

      <description>Pankhuri and I needed to rename a method and change all the places where it was used and decided to see if we could work out how to do it using sed.
We needed to change a method call roughly like this:
home_link(current_user)  To instead read:
homepage_path  For which we need the following sed expression:
sed -i &#39;s/home_link([^)]*)/homepage_path/&#39; [file_name]  Which works pretty well if you know which file you want to change but we wanted to run it over the whole code base.</description>

      <description>I recently travelled to London and back for Christmas using Jet Airways and the whole journey got off to an &amp;lsquo;interesting&amp;rsquo; start.
I originally booked two Jet Airways flights - one from Pune to Delhi and another from Delhi to London.
A couple of weeks later I was sent an email cancelling my Pune to Delhi flight and informing me that I should contact their customer support centre.
I quickly browsed their website to check what had happened to my flight and found out that it had actually changed from being a Jet Airways flight and was now in fact a Jet Lite flight - their sister airline.</description>

      <description>Ashwin and I were recently discussing integration points in software systems and in particular how many systems are designed in such a way that they will stop the user from going any further if one of those integration points is down.
The main point in favour of designing systems in this way is that it&amp;rsquo;s logically very simple - all operations are synchronous and we don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about any offline processing.</description>

Therefore given the following array of values:
form_sections = [FormSection.new(:enabled =&amp;gt; false, :name =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, :order =&amp;gt; 1), FormSection.new(:enabled =&amp;gt; true, :name =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;, :order =&amp;gt; 2)]  We wanted to display those form sections which were disabled at the bottom of the page.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Vim instead of RubyMine for the last month or so and it&amp;rsquo;s been interesting observing the way that I browse code as I add plugins to make my life easier.
Between files I generally don&#39;t know exactly where in the folder structure different files live since I&#39;m used to being able to search by just the name i.e. RubyMine&#39;s Ctrl-N Yahuda Katz wrote a blog post earlier in the year where he listed some of the plugins he&#39;s been using - one of which is called Command-T and allows exactly this functionality.</description>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2010/12/27/india-cultural-differences-hierarchy/</guid>
      <description>One of the more interesting differences between Indian culture and my own is that in India there appears to be more adherence to a hierarchy than I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced before.
ThoughtWorks tries to keep a reasonably flat hierarchy so I think the idea of hierarchy would be much more obvious if I was working at one of the big Indian services organisations.
Between peers conversations don&amp;rsquo;t seem to play out any differently but someone in a position of authority is more likely to be able to get their opinion across and accepted with less resistance than they might experience without that authority.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading The Goal over the last week or so where Eliyahu Goldratt describes the theory of constraints as a philosophy for allowing organisations to continually achieve their goal.
Goldratt goes on to describe bottlenecks - resources which have a capacity less than the capacity being demanded of the system.
The capacity of the system cannot be higher than that of the bottleneck which means that we need to find a way to optimise the bottlenecks in any system.</description>

      <description>For the majority of the time that I&amp;rsquo;ve spent in Pune so far language hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a big deal at all but there are a couple of differences that I didn&amp;rsquo;t initially anticipate.
The local language While the official office language is English my colleagues seem more comfortable talking to each other in Hindi so quite frequently the conversation will move into Hindi if someone isn&amp;rsquo;t directly speaking to me.</description>

 &#34;I think whilst people are obviously deeply upset about the inconvenience, particularly at this time of year, of having their travel plans disrupted, most of what I am hearing is a sense of outrage about the way they were then treated when they were stranded at Heathrow airport.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago I briefly touched on the very stretched days I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced while working in India.
This is in contrast to what I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced in the UK and Australia where the day was much more time boxed and tended to go from 9am to 6pm.
At the moment we also have a call with colleagues in Chicago at 9pm for about 30-45 minutes so the day has now stretched out until nearly 10pm.</description>

In my time in India there seem to have been many more people going from offshore to onshore than the other way around but based on this experience I don&amp;rsquo;t think that should necessarily be the case.</description>

      <description>Some colleagues have been asking me recently what cultural differences I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed working in India compared to my experiences in the UK and Australia and one of the biggest differences by far is the amount of tolerance and patience people here have compared to me.
These attributes seem to show themselves in roughly two situations:
With respect to the environment We&#39;ve had some building work done in the Pune office recently which has meant that there&#39;s been extremely high volume drilling being done to the extent that you can barely hear someone who&#39;s sitting a couple of metres away.</description>

      <description>Back in 2007&amp;frasl;2008 when I worked on my first couple of projects at ThoughtWorks I always found it strange how frequently my colleagues would try and figure something out themselves rather than asking someone else (who already knew how to do it) how to do it.
Fast forward to 2010 and I find myself being the one encouraging people to figure things out themselves.
There&amp;rsquo;s still merit in communicating with colleagues when we&amp;rsquo;ve tried to work out how to do something and haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to figure it out but it&amp;rsquo;s also useful to not have this as our default mode.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year I wrote about some of the problems that we can run into when we have implicit assumptions in stories and another problematic approach I&amp;rsquo;ve seen around this area is where we end up with stories that are very heavily focused on technical implementation.
Initially this seems like it will work out pretty well since all the developer then needs to do is follow the steps that have been outlined for them but from my experience it seems to create more problems than it solves.</description>

      <description>At a lot of organisations that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked there is a tendency to prioritise bugs by a priority bucket.
We might therefore have priority buckets 1-4 where the bucket number indicates how important the bug is to fix and then any buckets ranked below 4 would not be fixed but would be logged anyway.
From what I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed this isn&amp;rsquo;t a particularly effective way of managing bugs.
To start with there tend to be a lot of discussions around what the priority of each bug should be where a QA will argue that it should be a higher priority while a developer disagrees.</description>

      <description>A few colleagues have asked me why I chose to work in India so I thought it would be interesting to explore what it is that appealed to me about working here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that there were 2 main drivers for me:
The buzz of the ThoughtWorks office I was in Bangalore in 2006 when I attended ThoughtWorks University and one of the things that stood out for me was the atmosphere in the Diamond District office.</description>

      <title>Ruby: One method, two parameter types</title>

      <description>One interesting thing that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed while coding in Ruby is that due to the dynamicness of the language it&amp;rsquo;s possible to pass values of different types into a given method as parameters.
For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently come across a few examples of methods designed like this:
def calculate_foo_prices(foos) ... [foos].flatten.each do |foo| # do something end end  This allows us to use the method like this:
# foos would come in as an array from the UI foos = [Foo.</description>

      <description>We recently had a problem to solve which at its core required us to iterate through a collection, look up a value for each key and then exit as soon as we&amp;rsquo;d found a value.
The original solution looped through the collection and then explicitly returned once a value had been found:
def iterative_version v = nil [1,2,3,4,5].each do |i| v = long_running_method i return v unless v.nil? end v end  def long_running_method(value) puts &amp;quot;inside the long running method with #{value}&amp;quot; return nil if value &amp;gt; 3 value end  Which we run like so:</description>

      <description>My former colleague Alexandre Martins recently pointed me to a presentation given by Jeff Patton at Agile Roots titled &amp;lsquo;Noone wants your stupid process&amp;rsquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s one of the most interesting talks I&amp;rsquo;ve watched recently.
In the talk Jeff cites globo.com as a case study of a company which is using an agile approach to development of their website but are starting to doubt whether it&amp;rsquo;s the best way to go about things.</description>

 Sometimes consulting reminds me of the movie Inception  &amp;hellip;which reminded me of a conversation I was having with a colleague here who&amp;rsquo;s been working on consulting engagements here for the last few months.
I was describing some of the things that I wanted to change on my team and she pointed out that I always described each change as something that I wanted to change rather than something which I wanted to see change.</description>

      <description>A colleague and I ran into an interesting problem today which we wanted to use local port forwarding to solve.
In our environment.rb file we have a Solr instance url defined like so:
SOLR_CONFIG = { :service_url =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;http://some.internal.address:9983/solr/sco_slave_1&amp;quot; }  It&amp;rsquo;s defined like that because our colleagues in Chicago have setup a Solr instance on a test environment and all the developers hit the same box.
In Pune everyone has Solr configured on their own box so we really wanted to configure that url to be &amp;lsquo;localhost&amp;rsquo; on port &amp;lsquo;8983&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>One of the problems I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed in several of the &amp;lsquo;agile&amp;rsquo; communication mechanisms (such as the standup or dev huddle) that we typically use on teams is that they focus almost entirely on verbal communication which only covers one of our learning styles - the auditory learning style.
The Learning Models The VAK learning style model describes a simple model covering the different learning styles that people have:
 Visual - seeing and reading.</description>

      <description>One of the trickiest things to do when working in bigger teams is ensuring that it is possible to parallelise the work we have across the number of pairs that we have available.
From my experience this problem happens much less frequently in smaller teams. Perhaps inevitably it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to find 2 or 3 things that can be worked on in parallel than it is to find 6 or 7 or more.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been in India for around 4 months and in that time I think I&amp;rsquo;ve probably interviewed more people than I have in the last 4 years.
Over this time I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realise that the two main things I&amp;rsquo;m looking for in candidates are passion and ability to communicate effectively.
It&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to pick up on whether someone is passionate about what they do in a conversation or while pairing with them but I find the communication aspect a bit more tricky.</description>

      <description>In another script I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on lately I wanted to call &amp;lsquo;mysql&amp;rsquo; but unfortunately on my machine it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;mysql5&amp;rsquo; rather than &amp;lsquo;mysql&amp;rsquo;.
I have an alias defined in &amp;lsquo;~/.bash_profile&amp;rsquo; so I can call &amp;lsquo;mysql&amp;rsquo; from the terminal whenever I want to.
alias mysql=mysql5  Unfortunately shell scripts don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have access to this alias and the only suggestion I&amp;rsquo;ve come across while googling this is to source &amp;lsquo;~/.bash_profile&amp;rsquo; inside the script.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a Ruby script to allow us to automate part of our Solr data setup and part of the task was to check that some environment variables were set and throw an exception if not.
I got a bit stuck initially trying to work out how to return a message showing only the missing environment variables but it turned out to be pretty simple when I came back to it a couple of hours later.</description>

      <description>Something which I&amp;rsquo;ve become fairly convinced about recently is that the environment that someone works in has far more impact on their perceived performance than their own individual skills.
Given that belief I&amp;rsquo;ve often got stuck answering why some people are better able to handle a difficult environment than others - in terms of accepting the situation and finding a way of being productive regardless.
Does this mean that they&amp;rsquo;re better than people who can&amp;rsquo;t work in that environment as effectively?</description>

      <description>Just over a year ago I wrote a post about learning one thing each day and since I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling to do this lately I thought I&amp;rsquo;d come back to this topic again.
My general thinking at the time I wrote that post was that sometimes it would be really difficult to find a way to learn anything on the project I was working on and the only way to learn would be to play around with something outside work.</description>

      <description>I read Dan Pink&amp;rsquo;s A Whole New Mind earlier in the year but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard of The Adventures of Johnny Bunko until my colleague Sumeet Moghe mentioned it in a conversation during ThoughtWorks India&amp;rsquo;s XConf, an internal conference run here.
The book is written in the Manga format so it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly quick to read and it gives 6 ideas around building a career.
I&amp;rsquo;m generally not a fan of the idea of &amp;lsquo;building a career&amp;rsquo; - generally when I hear that phrase it involves having a &amp;lsquo;five year&amp;rsquo; plan and other such concepts which I consider to be pointless.</description>

      <description>One of the cool things about software development is that despite writing code for 5 years professionally and just under 10 altogether, there are still a phenomenal number of things that I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to do.
The learning opportunities are vast!
One of the areas which I&amp;rsquo;ve known I don&amp;rsquo;t know that much about is Unix command line tools such as awk and sed.
Since the majority of projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on have involved using Windows as the development environment I&amp;rsquo;ve never had extended exposure to the types of problems we get on a project which require their use.</description>

      <description>Priyank and I have been working on automating part of our deployment process and one task we needed to do as part of this is replace some variables used in one of our shell scripts.
All the variables in the script refer to production specific locations but we needed to change a couple of them in order to run the script in our QA environment.
We&amp;rsquo;re therefore written a sed command, which we call from Capistrano, to allow us to do this.</description>

So in our config directory would look something like this when you first checkout the project:
 config  database.yml.example some.yml.example  And we&amp;rsquo;d need to copy those files to get &amp;lsquo;.</description>

      <description>Despite being part of numerous retrospectives over the past few years I don&amp;rsquo;t remember actually facilitating one until my current team&amp;rsquo;s last week.
I&amp;rsquo;ve gradually come to appreciate the skill involved in facilitating this type of meeting having originally been of the opinion that there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to it.
I recently read Agile Retrospectives which has loads of different ideas for activities beyond just creating &amp;lsquo;went well&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;could improve&amp;rsquo; columns and then filling those in as a group.</description>

      <description>A fairly common trend on nearly every project I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on is that at some stage the client will ask for more people to be added to the team in order to &amp;lsquo;improve&amp;rsquo; the velocity.
Some of the most common arguments against doing so are that it will initially slow down the team&amp;rsquo;s velocity as the new members learn the domain, code base and get to know the other members of the team.</description>

      <description>Priyank and I have been pairing a bit lately and we thought it&amp;rsquo;d be interesting to try and not use the mouse for anything that we had to do while pairing.
Editor Priyank uses GVim (Yehuda Katz recommends MacVim if you&amp;rsquo;re using Mac OS) so we already don&amp;rsquo;t need to use the mouse at all when we&amp;rsquo;re inside the editor.
One annoying thing we found is that sometimes we wanted to copy stuff from the terminal into GVim and couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of a good way to do that without selecting the text on the terminal with a mouse and then &amp;lsquo;Ctrl-C&amp;rsquo;ing.</description>

      <description>Although we mostly split the work on my project so that there aren&amp;rsquo;t too many dependencies between the teams in Chicago and Pune, there have still been some times when we&amp;rsquo;ve designed major parts of the code base in Pune and have needed to communicate that to our Chicago colleagues.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen this situation so it&amp;rsquo;s been interesting to see which approaches work in trying to do this effectively and allowing the people in the other location to have input as well.</description>

      <description>I recently learnt about quite a neat feature of Active Record called nested attributes which allows you to save attributes on associated records of a parent model.
It&amp;rsquo;s been quite useful for us as we have a few pages in our application where the user is able to update models like this.
We would typically end up with parameters coming into the controller like this:
class FoosController &amp;lt; ApplicationController def update # params = { :id =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, :foo =&amp;gt; { :baz =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;new_baz&amp;quot;, :bar_attributes =&amp;gt; { :value =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; } } } Foo.</description>

      <description>Continuing with my series of observations on what it&amp;rsquo;s like working in a distributed agile team, another thing that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is that it&amp;rsquo;s useful to try and ensure that there is communication between as many people as possible in the two cities.
This means that we want to ensure that we don&amp;rsquo;t have an over reliance on one person to handle any communication.
We have a call once a day between developers in Pune and Chicago and the Chicago guys have been able to achieve this by rotating the person attending the call.</description>

      <description>Following on from my blog post about some observations about the actions that we create in retrospectives I&amp;rsquo;ve also noticed some general ways that retrospectives might not end up being as useful as we&amp;rsquo;d hope.
Having a manager facilitating While having the manager of the team facilitating the retrospective isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem in itself I think it&amp;rsquo;s useful to remember that in this context they aren&amp;rsquo;t in that role anymore.</description>

In it he talks quite generally about things he&amp;rsquo;s noticed but in my experience one of the areas in which teams typically struggle is when it comes to action items.
Too many action items I think this is probably the number one mistake that we make in retrospectives and it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to make.</description>

      <description>From my last couple of months working for ThoughtWorks in Pune I think the most common subject that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard discussed is how to ensure that the team offshore is receiving all the context about the decisions and direction being taken onshore.
What I&amp;rsquo;ve found most interesting is that I think out of all the teams that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on in the last four years my current team has by far the most context about what the client wants to do and the approaches they want to take over the next few months.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve also seen some useful ideas that my colleagues have used in meetings that I&amp;rsquo;ve been part of.</description>

      <title>Ruby: Getting Active Record validation errors twice</title>
      <link>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2010/10/29/ruby-getting-active-record-validation-errors-twice/</link>

      <description>I managed to create an interesting problem for myself while playing around with some code whereby I was ending up with validation errors appearing twice every time I called &amp;lsquo;valid?&amp;rsquo; on a specific model.
I figured I was probably doing something stupid and in fact a few replies by Aaron Baldwin on a mailing list thread on &amp;lsquo;rubyonrails-talk&amp;rsquo; helped explain exactly what I&amp;rsquo;d done:
 Are you calling require &#39;employee&#39; anywhere?</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re using Web Mock on my current project to stub out some of the external web requests in some of our integration tests and I managed to get myself very confused while trying to use a variable inside a regular expression that I was trying to pass to the &amp;lsquo;stub_request&amp;rsquo; method.
The code was roughly like this:
some_url = &amp;quot;http://service.com/method&amp;quot; stub_request(:any, /some_url/). to_return(:body =&amp;gt; File.new(&#39;/path/to/some.xml&#39;), :headers =&amp;gt; {&#39;Content-Length&#39; =&amp;gt; 666, &#39;Content-Type&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;text/xml&#39;}, :status =&amp;gt; 200, :headers =&amp;gt; {&#39;Content-Type&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;text/xml&#39;})  The request was being stubbed when I hard coded the url inside the regular expression but not being stubbed when I used the variable like in the example above.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d always heard that communication when you&amp;rsquo;re working offshore was much more difficult than in a co-located team but it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult to imagine exactly what the difficulties are until you see them for yourself.
These are some of my latest observations in this area so far.
Learning models I&#39;m a very visual learner and the majority of the time any communication between people in two different locations will be done through words either via email or on a conference call.</description>

      <description>I think one of the most important skills to perfect when communicating with other people is to understand the level of detail that we need to be speaking at, something my colleague Ashwin Raghav refers to as our logging level.
We log various things in our code at varying logging levels ranging from &amp;lsquo;error&amp;rsquo; through &amp;lsquo;debug&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;warn&amp;rsquo;, and each of these is useful for understanding what our code is doing.</description>

      <description>An approach to testing which I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen before and am therefore assuming is more specific to Ruby is the idea of stubbing or mocking out functions on the system under test.
I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a couple of situations where this seems to be done:
 When stubbing out calls to methods which are being mixed into the class via a module When stubbing out calls to private methods within the class  I think the first approach is fine because typically we&amp;rsquo;ll have a direct test against that module&amp;rsquo;s methods elsewhere and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense to test the same thing again.</description>

      <description>One of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed while working with various colleagues over the last few years is that the more experienced ones are much more skilled at making slight adjustments to their approach based on feedback that they receive from the environment.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a couple of books on systems thinking over the last few months and one of the takeaways for me has been that we need to be careful when reacting to feedback we get from a system to ensure that we don&amp;rsquo;t over compensate and end up creating a new problem for ourselves instead.</description>

All the work in one place We initially started off by having stories on one part of the wall, bugs on another part and any technical tasks stored in Mingle somewhere.</description>

      <description>My colleague Aman King is back in Pune for the time being and during one of our conversations he was asking me why I didn&amp;rsquo;t wait a bit longer and learn more about Ruby before writing about it.
In a way he is right and I didn&amp;rsquo;t write anything at all about C# or Java when I was first learning how to write code in those languages because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the confidence to write about something that I knew nothing about.</description>

      <description>When I started working on my current project there was no physical story wall, instead the whole project was being tracked on Mingle.
The current state of the Mingle story wall was sometimes visible on a shared monitor and sometimes wasn&amp;rsquo;t, depending on whether or not the monitor had been turned off.
There was also a small wall used to track which stories were in development but after that there was no physical visibility of the status of anything.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been flicking through Growing Object Oriented Software Guided By Tests again and in Chapter 6 on Object Oriented Style I came across the part of the chapter which talks about writing context independent code which reminded me of some code I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on recently.
The authors suggest the following:
 A system is easier to change if its objects are context-independent; that is, if each object has no built-in knowledge about the system in which it executes  I was writing a bit of code in our ApplicationHelper which would only be used in a certain context within one of the views.</description>

The bit of code which initially confused me is in RouteSet.add_named_route:
module ActionController module Routing class RouteSet def initialize ... self.named_routes = NamedRouteCollection.new end def add_named_route(name, path, options = {}) # TODO - is options EVER used? name = options[:name_prefix] + name.</description>

      <description>I came across an article written a few months ago titled &amp;lsquo;Outsourcing doesn&amp;rsquo;t work&amp;rsquo; which discussed some of the problems the author has experienced while working with teams offshore.
The article is provocatively titled but has some interesting observations which I thought I could contrast with my own after working offshore in Pune, India for a couple of months now.
The team I&amp;rsquo;m working on is distributed between Pune and Chicago so it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the same situation as the author&amp;rsquo;s but the majority of the team are in a different country to the client.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been pairing a fair bit with Ashwin this week and one thing he showed me which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t previously seen is the ability to set a default value for a hash which gets returned if we search for a key that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist.
This is an idea that I originally came across while playing around with Clojure but with Clojure the default value was defined in the calling code rather than in the hash definition.</description>

      <description>Something which I keep forgetting is how to write controller tests where I want to check whether an action correctly redirected to another action.
With most of the routes in our application we&amp;rsquo;ve created a &amp;lsquo;resourceful route&amp;rsquo; where each action maps to a CRUD operation in the database.
We can do that with this type of code in routes.rb:
ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map| map.resources :foos end  Several helper methods based on named rotes get created and included in our controllers when we do this and we have access to those inside our specs.</description>

      <description>I recently came across quite an interesting post written by Steve Garnett where he discusses the difference between constraints and impediments inside organisations.
He comes to the following conclusion:
 For me, the difference between an impediment and a constraint is whether the individual, team, organisation, enterprise, or industry considers the obstacle as removable. If whoever is working with the obstacle believes it can be removed then it is considered an impediment, if the same person doesn&#39;t not believe it can be removed, or doesn&#39;t wish to work towards it&#39;s removal, it&#39;s considered a constraint.</description>

      <description>Ashwin and I have been working recently on a bit of code to make it possible to &amp;lsquo;soft delete&amp;rsquo; some objects in our system.
We&amp;rsquo;re doing this by creating an additional column in that table called &amp;lsquo;deleted_at_date&amp;rsquo; which we populate if a record is &amp;lsquo;deleted&amp;rsquo;.
As we wanted the rest of the application to ignore &amp;lsquo;deleted&amp;rsquo; records we added a default scope to it:
class Foo &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base default_scope :conditions =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;deleted_at_date is null&amp;quot; end  This works fine but we wanted to be able to see the status of all the records in IRB and with the default scope &amp;lsquo;Foo.</description>

      <description>Something which can often happen with agile software development teams is that in the desire to take everyone&amp;rsquo;s opinion into account for every decision we end up having a lot of meetings.
Toni wrote about this a while ago and described a situation where he&amp;rsquo;d managed to get rid of a meeting and just have a discussion after the stand up with the necessary people.
While this is a good idea I still think there are occasions where it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary to discuss every problem down to the minute details with the whole team.</description>

      <description>One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed while browsing our Rails code base is that the first entry point inside a controller is much less frequently the method corresponding to the action than it would be with a C# ASP.NET MVC application.
The concept of filters exists in ASP.NET MVC but on the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on they&amp;rsquo;ve been used significantly less than before filters would be in a Rails application.
As a result I&amp;rsquo;m getting much more in the habit of checking for the before filters in the ApplicationController when an action isn&amp;rsquo;t working as expected to try and figure out what&amp;rsquo;s going on.</description>

      <description>I just came across a really cool blog post written a couple of months ago by Evan Light where he proposes that we &amp;lsquo;write the first one ugly&amp;lsquo;:
 To overcome paralysis, for small chunks of code, it is often better to just write whatever comes to mind – no matter how awful it may seem at the time. Give yourself permission to let the first version suck.  I think this is a really good piece of advice and it seems along the same lines as a suggestion from Uncle Bob in Clean Code:</description>

Both objects referred to the same user in the database but were different instances in memory.
We needed to check that we were referring to the same user for one piece of functionality and were therefore able to make use of the &amp;lsquo;==&amp;rsquo; method defined on ActiveRecord::Base which is defined in the documentation like so:</description>

My immediate thought was that there should be some methods available similar to what we have in C# which Mike Wagg and I spoke about in our talk about using functional programming techniques in C#.
I was expecting to find methods with names indicating the operation they perform but in actual fact the methods are more like operators which makes for code that reads really well.</description>

      <description>We ran into a somewhat frustrating problem while using Factory Girl to create an object which had a &amp;lsquo;has_and_belongs_to_many&amp;rsquo; association with another object.
The relevant code in the two classes was like this..
class Bar &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base has_and_belongs_to_many :foos, :class_name =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Foo&amp;quot;, :join-table =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;bar_foos&amp;quot; end  class Foo &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base has_many :bars end  &amp;hellip;and we originally defined our &amp;lsquo;Bar&amp;rsquo; factory like so:
Factory.define :bar do |f| f.association(:foos, :factory =&amp;gt; :foo) end  Factory.</description>

class Mark def self.random(params) &amp;quot;do some amazing stuff&amp;quot; end end  class Another def a_method random = Mark.random(&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;) # use random for something end end  When we ran the spec we would get the following error message which was initially a little baffling:</description>

      <description>While testing some code that we were mixing into one of our controllers we made what I thought was an interesting mistake.
The module we wanted to test had some code a bit like this&amp;hellip;
module OurModule def some_method @User = User.find(params[:id]) # in the test code this is always true if @user == user ... end end end  ..and we had the spec setup like so:
describe &#39;OurController&#39; do class TestController include OurModule attr_accessor :user end before(:each) do @controller = TestController.</description>

      <description>Something I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed while reading Ruby code is that quite frequently the flow of a program is controlled by the &amp;lsquo;chaining&amp;rsquo; of different operations through use of the &amp;lsquo;and&amp;rsquo; keyword.
I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that this pattern is used in Javascript code as well and it&amp;rsquo;s particularly prevalent when we want to get a status for those operations after they&amp;rsquo;ve all been executed.
For example we might have the following code&amp;hellip;
status = user.</description>

One way around it is to ensure that we explicitly return a_hash at the end of the method&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I was looking back over a post I wrote a couple of years ago where I described some learning cycles that I&amp;rsquo;d noticed myself going through with respect to code and although at the time I was thinking of those cycles in terms of code I think they are applicable at a project level as well.
The cycles I described were as follows:
 Don&#39;t know what is good and what&#39;s bad Learn what&#39;s good and what&#39;s bad but don&#39;t know how to fix something that&#39;s bad Learn how to make something that&#39;s bad good  I think I&amp;rsquo;ve followed similar cycles with respect to how an overall project is run.</description>

      <description>We recently had a requirement to delete an item based on user input and wanting to adhere to the &amp;lsquo;RESTful&amp;rsquo; approach that Rails encourages we therefore needed to fake a HTTP Delete method request.
The documentation talks a little about this:
 The Rails framework encourages RESTful design of your applications, which means you’ll be making a lot of “PUT” and “DELETE” requests (besides “GET” and “POST”). However, most browsers don’t support methods other than “GET” and “POST” when it comes to submitting forms.</description>

The :: operator (apparently also known as the leading double colon operator) I came across this while looking at some of the rails_warden code to try to understand how that gem opens the ActionController::Base class to add helper methods to it.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a post earlier in the week we&amp;rsquo;re using the declarative_authorization gem to control access to various parts of our application and as we&amp;rsquo;ve been migrating parts of the code base over to use that framework one thing we&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is that there seems to be a diminishing return in how much value we get from writing specs to cover each rule that we create.
We found that while it is possible to write a spec to cover every single rule it sometimes seems like the spec is just duplicating what the rule already describes.</description>

 A function f is defined by the rule that f(n) = n if n3. Write a procedure that computes f by means of a recursive process.</description>

      <description>I got caught out for a little while today when comparing a value coming into a controller from &amp;lsquo;params&amp;rsquo; which we were then comparing with a collection of numbers.
The code was roughly like this&amp;hellip;
class SomeController def some_action some_collection = [1,2,3,4,5] selected_item = some_collection.find { |item| item == params[:id] } end end  &amp;hellip;and since the &amp;lsquo;id&amp;rsquo; being passed in was &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo; I was expected that we should have a selected item but we didn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Two other gems that we&amp;rsquo;re using on my current project are FactoryGirl and declarative_authorization.
We use declarative_authorization for controlling access to various parts of the application and FactoryGirl allows us to build objects for use in our tests.
We wanted to be able to deactivate the authorization when creating test objects because otherwise our test wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have permission to create certain objects.
Our original approach was to create a &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo; role which we could assign to the &amp;lsquo;current_user&amp;rsquo; in our tests therefore allowing us to create whatever objects we wanted.</description>

The author starts out by making some interesting observations about spacing out our learning:  An hour of study tonight, an hour on the weekend, another session a week from now: such so-called spacing improves later recall, without requiring students to put in more overall study effort or pay more attention, dozens of studies have found.</description>

      <description>One interesting feature of Rails which Shishir pointed out the other day is the ability to take a user provided value and make use of Active Support&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;constantize&amp;rsquo; method to effectively achieve polymorphism directly from the user&amp;rsquo;s input.
As an example if we were creating different types of widgets from the same web page we might have several different forms that the user could submit.
We could have a hidden field representing the type of the widget like so:</description>

More as an attempt to help myself remember than anything else, the method we want is actually called &amp;lsquo;include?&amp;rsquo;.
Therefore&amp;hellip;
[1,2,3].include?(2) =&amp;gt; true  [1,2,3,4].</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re using the tabs part of the jQuery UI library on the project I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on and one thing we wanted to do was change the default tab that was being selected.
The documentation suggested that one way to do this was to give the index of the tab we wanted selected when calling the tabs function:
$( &amp;quot;.selector&amp;quot; ).tabs({ selected: 3 });  Since we wanted to select the tab by name based on a value from the query string we thought it would probably be simpler if we could just set the selected tab using a css class.</description>

      <description>The application that I&amp;rsquo;m working on at the moment is deployed into production on JRuby but we also use the C Ruby 1.8.7 interpreter when developing locally since this allows us much quicker feedback.
As a result we sometimes come across interesting differences in the way that the two runtimes work.
One that we noticed yesterday is that if you create a hash, the order of the keys in the hash will be preserved when interpreted on JRuby but not with the C Ruby interpreter.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve never quite been able to put my finger on exactly what makes a design simple and there is frequently disagreement about what is even considered simple.
On the last project I worked on we had an interesting problem where we wanted to partially update different parts of an object from different pages of the application.</description>

My colleague pointed out that we&amp;rsquo;d need to use &amp;lsquo;collection_select&amp;rsquo; in order to do this.
We want to put the values in the &amp;lsquo;foos&amp;rsquo; collection onto the page. &amp;lsquo;foos&amp;rsquo; is a hash which defines some display values and their corresponding values like so:</description>

      <description>One of the earliest rules of thumb that I was taught by my colleagues is the idea that we should try and avoid mutating/changing values passed into a function as a parameter.
The underlying reason as I understand it is that if you&amp;rsquo;re just skimming through the code you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily expect the values of incoming parameters to be different depending where in the function they&amp;rsquo;re used.
I think the most dangerous example of this is when we completely change the value of a parameter, like so:</description>

      <description>Another library that we&amp;rsquo;re using on my project is ActionMailer and before reading through the documentation I was confused for quite a while with respect to how it actually worked.
We have something similar to the following piece of code&amp;hellip;
Emailer.deliver_some_email  &amp;hellip;which when you click its definition in RubyMine takes you to this class definition:
class Emailer &amp;lt; ActionMailer::Base def some_email recipients &amp;quot;some@email.com&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;some_other_email@whatever.com&amp;quot; # and so on end end  I initially thought that method was called &amp;lsquo;deliver_some_mail&amp;rsquo; but having realised that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t I was led to the &amp;lsquo;magic&amp;rsquo; that is &amp;lsquo;method_missing&amp;rsquo; on &amp;lsquo;ActionMailer::Base&amp;rsquo; which is defined as follows:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a little time browsing through some of the libraries used by my project and one thing which I noticed in ActiveSupport is that fields don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be accessed directly but rather are accessed through a method which effectively encapsulates them inside the object.
For example the following function is defined in &amp;lsquo;inheritable_attributes.rb&amp;rsquo;
def write_inheritable_attribute(key, value) if inheritable_attributes.equal?(EMPTY_INHERITABLE_ATTRIBUTES) @inheritable_attributes = {} end inheritable_attributes[key] = value end  def inheritable_attributes @inheritable_attributes ||= EMPTY_INHERITABLE_ATTRIBUTES end  EMPTY_INHERITABLE_ATTRIBUTES = {}.</description>

      <description>In Continuous Delivery the authors talk about the danger of ultimate configurability&amp;hellip;
 Configurable software is not always the cheaper solution it appears to be. It’s almost always better to focus on delivering the high-value functionality with little configuration and then add configuration options later when necessary  &amp;hellip;and from my experience when you take this over configurability to its logical conclusion you end up developing a framework that can hopefully just be &amp;lsquo;configured&amp;rsquo; for any number of &amp;lsquo;front ends&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Seth Godin recently wrote a post about &amp;lsquo;the fear tax&amp;rsquo; which he describes as a &amp;lsquo;tax&amp;rsquo; that we pay when we do something in order to try and calm our fear about something else but don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily end up calming those fears.
 We pay the fear tax every time we spend time or money seeking reassurance. We pay it twice when the act of seeking that reassurance actually makes us more anxious, not less.</description>

      <title>Database configuration: Just like any other change</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been flicking through Continuous Deployment and one section early on about changing configuration information in our applications particularly caught my eye:
 In our experience, it is an enduring myth that configuration information is somehow less risky to change than source code. Our bet is that, given access to both, we can stop your system at least as easily by changing the configuration as by changing the source code.  In many organisations where I&amp;rsquo;ve worked this is generally adhered to except when it comes to configuration which is controlled from the database!</description>

      <title>iPad: Getting PragProg books onto the Kindle App</title>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned previously I think the Kindle application on the iPad is the best one for reading books and as a result of that I wanted to be able to read some books which I&amp;rsquo;d bought from the PragProg store onto it.
The first step is to download the &amp;lsquo;.mobi&amp;rsquo; version of the book and use iPhoneExplorer to drag the file into the &amp;lsquo;Kindle/Documents/eBook&amp;rsquo; folder on the iPad.
This works fine but if you add more than one book in this way they all have the same cover image when viewed on the iPad which is quite annoying when trying to work out which book is which.</description>

      <description>Jonas Boner recently linked to a really cool (and short) presentation by John Cleese about creativity which I think is very applicable to software development.

Cleese describes some observations he&amp;rsquo;s made about creativity from his experiences working in comedy. These were some of the key ideas:
Plan to throw one away? Cleese describes a situation where he wrote a script for Fawlty Towers and then lost it. He decided to rewrite it from memory and after he&#39;d done that he found the original.</description>

      <description>Jez recently linked to a post written by Timothy Fitz about a year ago where he talks about the way his team use continuous delivery which means that every change made to the code base goes into production immediately as long as it passes their test suite.
I&amp;rsquo;ve become fairly convinced recently that it should always be possible to deploy to production frequently but we recently came across a situation where it seemed like doing that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense.</description>

      <description>A mistake I&amp;rsquo;ve made more than a few times while declaring headers in Objective C is forgetting to explicitly import the classes used in the interface definition.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been refactoring some of the code I wrote earlier in the week and wanted to create a &amp;lsquo;LabelFactory&amp;rsquo;. I had the following code:
LabelFactory.h
#import &amp;lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&amp;gt; @interface LabelFactory : NSObject { } + (UILabel*)createLabelFrom:(Project *)project withXCoordinate:(NSInteger)x withYCoordinate:(NSInteger)y; @end  Which gives this error on compilation:</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time working through the first Micro Testing album of the Industrial Logic eLearning suite a few weeks ago and there&amp;rsquo;s an interesting piece of advice towards the end of the album:
 Microtesting is not a formula. It&#39;s a technique. When microtesting rigorously, you will be called constantly to make judgments like these, between one set of names and another, and their corresponding approaches. Remember the judgment premise.</description>

      <description>One thing I noticed while pairing with some of the ThoughtWorks University guys a few weeks ago is that I had an almost overwhelming urge to show them all sorts of coding techniques that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, probably to the point where it&amp;rsquo;d be more confusing than helpful.
JK pointed out that it&amp;rsquo;s more effective to bite your tongue and just focus on one idea at a time which is something that the authors of Agile Coaching touch on briefly at the beginning of the book:</description>

      <description>One of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed as we&amp;rsquo;ve started writing more client side code is that I&amp;rsquo;m much more likely to look for a library which solves a problem than I would be with server side code.
A requirement that we&amp;rsquo;ve had on at least the last 3 or 4 projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on is to do client side validation on the values entered into a form by the user.</description>

      <description>Sumeet recently blogged about the new style ThoughtWorks University that he and the other trainers have introduced and although I only got to see it in action for a few days it seemed clear to me that it was an improvement on the original version.
The questions being asked, discussions being had and situations that were coming up were pretty much the same as I&amp;rsquo;ve seen on any software project that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a post I wrote last week I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a little iPad application to parse a cctray feed and then display the status of the various builds on the screen.
The way I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this is by dynamically adding labels to the view and colouring the background of those labels red or green depending on the build status.
FirstViewController.h
@interface FirstViewController : UIViewController { ... NSMutableArray *dynamicallyAddedFields; }  FirstViewController.</description>

      <description>Dave Astels mentions in his BDD paper that the way we use language influences the way that we write code, quoting the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
 “there is a systematic relationship between the grammatical categories of the language a person speaks and how that person both understands the world and behaves in it.”  In a similar way, something which I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully appreciate until the last project I worked on is how much the tools and techniques that you use can influence the way that you work.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my previous post about parsing an XML file in Objective C I&amp;rsquo;m a novice on the Dreyfus Model when it comes to this type of development and I&amp;rsquo;ve found it interesting that I&amp;rsquo;ve dropped back into habits from my PHP days when I was first learning how to program.
The big picture My first instinct after I&amp;rsquo;d created a project in XCode was to try and understand how an iPad application fits together.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to try out some iPad development for a while and as a hello worldish exercise for myself I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try and work out how to parse the cctray.xml file from Sam Newman&amp;rsquo;s bigvisiblewall.
Realising that I&amp;rsquo;m a novice on the Dreyfus Model when it comes to Objective C I started out by following a tutorial from iPhone SDK Articles which explained how to do this.
The first thing I learnt is that the built in library follows an event driven approach to handling XML.</description>

      <description>Nikhil and I were discussing some of the ideas around Test Driven Development earlier in the week and at one stage I pointed out that I quite liked Bryan Liles&amp;rsquo; idea of &amp;lsquo;make it pass or change the message&amp;rsquo;.
Bryan suggests that when we have a failing test our next step should be to make that test pass or at least write some code which results in us getting a different error message and hopefully one step closer to making the test pass.</description>

      <description>Following the recommendations of Corey Haines, Michael Guterl, James Martin and Michael Hunger I decided to get Kent Beck&amp;rsquo;s screencasts on Test Driven Development which have been published by the Pragmatic Programmers.
I read Kent&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Test Driven Development By Example&amp;rsquo; book a couple of years ago and remember enjoying that so I was intrigued as to what it would be like to see some of those ideas put into practice in real time.</description>

      <description>One of the other neat ideas I was reminded of when watching Kent Beck&amp;rsquo;s TDD screencasts is the value of &amp;lsquo;calling your shots&amp;rsquo; i.e. writing a test and then saying what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen when you run that test.
It reminds me of an exercise we used to do in tennis training when I was younger.
The coach would feed the ball to you and just before you hit it you had to say exactly where on the court you were going to place it - cross court/down the line and short/deep.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching Kent Beck&amp;rsquo;s TDD screencasts and in the 3rd episode he reminded me of a mistake I used to make when I was first learning how to test drive code.
The mistake happens when testing collections and I would write a test which would pass even if the collection had nothing in it.
The code would look something like this:
[Test] public void SomeTestOfACollection() { var someObject = new Object(); var aCollection = someObject.</description>

The format of these showcases has been fairly similar each time but the people who attended has tended to vary depending on the situation.
As part of the project being worked on at ThoughtWorks University we&amp;rsquo;ve run a showcase at the end of each week which the whole team have been attending.</description>

      <description>One of the requirements that the ThoughtWorks University grads have been given on the internal project they&amp;rsquo;re working on is to ensure that they leave the code base in a good state so that the next batch can potentially continue from where they left off.
The application will be deployed on Thursday and this means that a lot of the time this week will be spent refactoring certain areas of the code base rather than only adding new functionality.</description>

      <description>Brian, Tejas and I (well mainly them) have been working on an application to give badges to people based on their GitHub activity at the Yahoo Open Hack Day in Bangalore and we&amp;rsquo;ve been making use of Bundler to pull in our dependencies.
Our Gemfile was originally like this:
gem &amp;quot;sinatra&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; gem &amp;quot;haml&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;3.0.13&amp;quot; gem &amp;quot;activesupport&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;3.0.0.beta4&amp;quot;, :require =&amp;gt; false gem &amp;quot;tzinfo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;0.3.22&amp;quot; gem &amp;quot;nokogiri&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1.4.2&amp;quot; ...  For quite a while we were wondering why &amp;lsquo;bundle install&amp;rsquo; wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually resolving anything at all before we RTFM and realised that we needed to call &amp;lsquo;source&amp;rsquo; at the top so that bundler knows where to pull the dependencies from.</description>

      <description>I recently came a blog post written by Matt Ward describing some habits to make you a better coder and while he presented a lot of good ideas I found myself disagreeing with his 2nd tip:
 2. Write Your Logic through Comments When it comes to coding, there are many tenets and ideas I stand by. One of this is that code is 95% logic. Another is that logic doesn’t change when translated from human language into a programming language.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently working as a trainer for ThoughtWorks University (TWU) and the participants have some Industrial Logic e-learning material to work through before they take part in the 6 week training program.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working through the refactoring/code smells courses myself and while I&amp;rsquo;ve been finding it really useful, I think this was partly because I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to link the material to situations that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in code bases that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on over the past few years.</description>

      <description>Something that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed over the last few years is that when people give feedback to each other there is often an over emphasis on the individual and less attention paid to the environment in which they were working.
I covered this a bit in a blog post I wrote about a year ago titled &amp;lsquo;Challenging projects and the Kubler Ross Grief Cycle&amp;rsquo; which I converted into a presentation that I gave at XP2010 in June.</description>

      <description>I recently came across an interesting post about pair programming by Paritosh Ranjan where he outlines some of the problems he&amp;rsquo;s experienced with this practice.
While some of the points that he raises are certainly valid I think they&amp;rsquo;re more evidence of pair programming not being done in an effective way rather than a problem with the idea in itself.
To take one example:
 Generally people don’t think a lot while pair programming as the person who wants to think about the pros and cons will be considered inefficient (as he will slow down the coding speed).</description>

      <description>Following on from my post about the value we found in acceptance tests on our project when doing a large scale refactoring I had an interesting discussion with Jak Charlton and Ben Hall about deleting unit tests when they&amp;rsquo;re no longer needed.
The following is part of our discussion:
Ben:  @JakCharlton @markhneedham a lot (not all) of the unit tests created can be deleted once the acceptance tests are passing&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>One of the more interesting presentations doing the rounds on twitter and on our internal mailing lists is the following one by Dan Pink titled &amp;lsquo;Drive - The surprising truth about what motivates us&amp;rsquo;.

This topic generally interests me anyway but it&amp;rsquo;s quite intriguing that the research Dan has gathered support for what I imagine many people intrinsically knew.
Incentives The presentation dispels the myth that money always works as a motivator for getting people to do what we want them to do.</description>

      <title>J: Tacit Programming</title>

      <description>A couple of months ago I wrote about tacit programming with respect to F#, a term which I first came across while reading about the J programming language.
There&amp;rsquo;s a good introduction to tacit programming on the J website which shows the evolution of a function which originally has several local variables into a state where it has none at all.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a go at writing Roy Osherove&amp;rsquo;s TDD Kata in J and while I haven&amp;rsquo;t got very far yet I saw a good opportunity to move the code I&amp;rsquo;ve written so far into a more tacit style.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve read a couple of Seth Godin&amp;rsquo;s other books - Tribes and The Dip - and found them fairly readable so I figured his latest offering, Linchpin, would probably be worth a read too.
This is the first book that I&amp;rsquo;ve read on the iPad&amp;rsquo;s Kindle application and it was a reasonably good reading experience - I particularly like the fact that you can make notes and highlight certain parts of the text.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago Dermot and I showcased a piece of functionality that we&amp;rsquo;d been working on - notably hiding some options in a drop down list.
We showcased this piece of functionality to the rest of the team in Firefox and it all worked correctly.
Our business analyst, who was also acting as QA, then had a look at the story in Internet Explorer 6 and we promptly realised that the way we&amp;rsquo;d solved the problem didn&amp;rsquo;t actually work in IE6.</description>

      <description>On the project that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on over the past few months one of the key benefits of the application was its ability to perform various calculations based on user input.
In order to check that these calculators are producing the correct outputs we created a series of acceptance tests that ran directly against one of the objects in the system.
We did this by defining the inputs and expected outputs for each scenario in an excel spreadsheet which we converted into a CSV file before reading that into an NUnit test.</description>

      <description>One thing that we tried to avoid on the project that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on is making use of C# expressions trees in production code.
We found that the areas of the code where we compiled these expressions trees frequently showed up as being the least performant areas of the code base when run through a performance profiler.
In a discussion about the ways to improve the performance of an application Christian pointed out that once we&amp;rsquo;ve identified the area for improvement there are two ways to do this:</description>

      <description>Yesterday evening I decided to try and upgrade the Ruby installation on my Mac from 1.8.7 to 1.9.2 and went on the yak shaving mission which is doing just that.
  RVM seems to be the way to install Ruby these days so I started off by installing that with the following command from the terminal:
bash &amp;lt; &amp;lt;( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )  That bit worked fine for me but there are further instructions on the RVM website if that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <description>On an internal mailing list my colleague David Pattinson recently described a feedback approach he&amp;rsquo;d used on a project where everyone on the team went into a room and they took turns giving direct feedback to each person.
Since we were finishing the project that we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for the past few months, Christian, Dermot and I decided to give it a try last week.
One thing to note is that this feedback wasn&amp;rsquo;t linked to any performance review, it was just between the 3 of us to allow us to find ways that we can be more effective on projects that we work on in the future.</description>

      <description>I recently watched a presentation given by Joshua Kerievsky from the Lean Software &amp;amp; Systems conference titled &amp;lsquo;The Limited Red Society&amp;rsquo; in which describes an approach to refactoring where we try to minimise the amount of time that the code is in a &amp;lsquo;red&amp;rsquo; state.
This means that the code should be compiling and the tests green for as much of this time as possible .
I think it&amp;rsquo;s very important to follow these principles in order to successfully refactor code on a project team and it&amp;rsquo;s an approach that my colleague Dave Cameron first introduced me to when we worked together last year.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written previously about the Mikado method and how I&amp;rsquo;ve made use of it for identifying ways in which I could refactor code but I think this approach is more generally applicable for any kind of code investigation.
Our application has a lot of calculations in it and we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to refactor the code which wires all the calculators up to make use of a DSL which reveals the intention of the code more as well as making it easier to test.</description>

      <description>I wrote a few weeks ago about incremental refactoring using a static factory method where we ended up with the following code:
public class LookUpKey { private readonly string param1; private readonly string param2; private readonly string param3; public LookUpKey(string param1, string param2, string param3) { this.param1 = param1; this.param2 = param2; this.param3 = param3; } public static LookUpKey CreateFrom(UserData userData) { var param1 = GetParam1From(userData); var param2 = GetParam2From(userData); var param3 = GetParam3From(userData); return new LookUpKey(param1, param2, param3); } public string Param1Key { { get { return param1; } } } .</description>

      <description>We recently had a requirement to dynamically update a drop down list based on how the user had filled in other parts of the page.
Our initial approach was to populate the drop down with all potential options on page load and then add CSS selectors to the options that we wanted to hide. That worked fine in Chrome and Firefox but Internet Explorer seems to ignore CSS selectors inside a drop down list so none of the options were being hidden.</description>

      <description>I wrote a couple of weeks ago about how we&amp;rsquo;d been trying to make use of the NHibernate 2nd level cache and we were able to cache our data by following the various posts that I listed.
Unfortunately when we ran some performance tests we found that the performance of the application was significantly worse than when we just wrote our own &amp;lsquo;cache&amp;rsquo; - an object which had a dictionary containing the reference data items we&amp;rsquo;d previously tried to lookup and the appropriate values.</description>

      <description>Something which Dermot, Christian and I noticed last week is that on our project we&amp;rsquo;ve reached the stage where we intuitively know what the underlying problem is for any given error message in the application we&amp;rsquo;re working on.
We&amp;rsquo;re pretty much at the stage where we&amp;rsquo;re effectively pattern matching what&amp;rsquo;s going on without needing to think that much anymore.
This is a good thing because it saves a lot of time analysing every single message to try and work out what&amp;rsquo;s going on - I think this means that we&amp;rsquo;ve reached a higher level of the Dreyfus model when it comes to this particular situation.</description>

 Surround yourself with developers who are better than you. Find a stronger team where you are the weakest member and have room to grow. Be the Worst was the seminal pattern of this pattern language. It was lifted from some advice that Pat Metheny offered to young musicians: “Be the worst guy in every band you’re in.</description>

      <description>One problem we&amp;rsquo;ve come across a few times over the last couple of months while using Mercurial is the situation where we want to quickly commit a local change without committing other local changes that we&amp;rsquo;ve made.
The example we came across today was where we wanted to make a change to the build file as we&amp;rsquo;d made a mistake in the target that runs on our continuous integration server and hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed for a while during which time we&amp;rsquo;d accumulated other local changes.</description>

      <description>Roy Osherove wrote a post about a month ago describing the different maturity levels of software teams and the strategies that he uses when leading each of these which I found quite interesting.
He describes the following states of maturity for a team:
 Chaotic Stage – the state where a team does not possess the skills, motives or ambition to become a mature self managing team. Mid-Life stage – where a team possesses some skills for self management and decision making , and can make some of its own decisions without needing a team lead.</description>

We have a stub collaborator which gets injected into our system under test. It looks roughly like this:</description>

Twitter I follow a lot of people involved in software development on twitter and come across a lot of interesting articles/blogs that people link to or write. A lot of the time I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to read those posts when I come across them - it would be much better if I could just save them to read later on.</description>

When using Git as your SCM it is normal to work for quite a while – maybe for a couple of days – in a local branch and without ever pushing the changes to the origin. Usually we only push when a feature is done or a defect is completely resolved.</description>

      <description>My colleague Dermot Kilroy attended the DDD 2010 Excange in London last week and one of the ideas that he&amp;rsquo;s been sharing with us from that is that of thinking how the user would solve a given problem without a technological solution i.e. how was something done before computers existed.
This encourages us to take a bigger picture view and can actually lead to a much simpler solution than we&amp;rsquo;d otherwise come up with.</description>

The code originally looked a bit like this:
public class LookupService { public LookUp Find(UserData userData) { var param1 = GetParam1From(userData); var param2 = GetParam2From(userData); var param3 = GetParam3From(userData); var lookupKey = new LookUpKey(param1, param2, param3); return lookupRepository.Find(lookupKey); } }  public class LookUpKey { private readonly string param1; private readonly string param2; private readonly string param3; public LookUpKey(string param1, string param2, string param3) { this.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to cache some objects using NHibernate&amp;rsquo;s second level cache which always proves to be a trickier task than I remember it being the previous time!
We&amp;rsquo;re storing some reference data in the database and then using LINQ to NHibernate to query for the specific row that we want based on some user entered criteria.
We can cache that query by calling &amp;lsquo;SetCacheable&amp;rsquo; on the &amp;lsquo;QueryOptions&amp;rsquo; property of our query:</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been fiddling around with Fluent NHibernate a bit over the last couple of days and one of the things that we wanted to do was output the NHibernate mapping files being generated so we could see if they were as expected.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to do it but thanks to the help of James Gregory, Andrew Bullock and Matthew Erbs on twitter this is the code that you need in order to do that:</description>

      <description>About a year ago I wrote a post about a book club we ran in Sydney covering &amp;lsquo;The readability of tests&amp;rsquo; from Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce&amp;rsquo;s book in which they suggest that their preferred way of writing tests is to drive them from the assertion up:
 Write Tests Backwards Although we stick to a canonical format for test code, we don&#39;t necessarily write tests from top to bottom. What we often do is: write the test name, which helps us decide what we want to achieve; write the call to the target code, which is the entry point for the feature; write the expectations and assertions, so we know what effects the feature should have; and, write the setup and teardown to define the context for the test.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago we had some C# code around calcuations which had got a bit too imperative in nature.
The code looked roughly like this:
public class ACalculator { public double CalculateFrom(UserData userData) { if(userData.Factor1 == Factor1.Option1) { return 1.0; } if(userData.Factor2 == Factor2.Option3) { return 2.0; } if(userData.Factor3 == Factor3.Option2) { return 3.0 } return 0.0; } }  I think there should be a more object oriented way to write this code whereby we push some of the logic onto the &amp;lsquo;UserData&amp;rsquo; object but it struck me that it reads a little bit like pattern matching code you might see in F#.</description>

      <description>On several of the projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on over the last couple of years we&amp;rsquo;ve seen the following situation evolve:
 The team starts coding the application. At some stage there is a breakthrough in understanding and a chance to really improve the code. However the deadline is tight and we wouldn&#39;t see a return within the time left if we refactored the code now The team keeps on going with the old approach The project ends up going on for longer than the original deadline It&#39;s now much more work to move towards the new solution  In the situations I describe the refactorings could have been done incrementally but doing that would take longer than continuing with the original approach and also leave the code in an inconsistent state.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on two different teams this year which had quite different approaches to retrospectives.
In the first team we had a retrospective at the beginning of every iteration i.e. once every two weeks and in the second team we tried out the idea of having a rolling retrospective i.e. we put up potential retrospective items on the wall and when there were enough of those we discussed them in the standup.</description>

It was interesting to see the way another conference was organised as the only other conference I&amp;rsquo;ve attended was QCon which is a much more technical conference.</description>

      <description>I gave a presentation at our ThoughtWorks Brazil office in Porto Alegre last way on some of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while working at ThoughtWorks and the first point I made was that it was better to &amp;lsquo;ask for forgiveness, not for permission&amp;rsquo;.
This was something that was taught to me a few years ago and the idea behind this is that if there&amp;rsquo;s some idea we want to try out it makes much more sense to start trying it now and then we can always apologise later on if someone has a problem with us doing that.</description>

      <description>A problem we had to solve on my current project is how to handle form submission where the user can click on a different button depending whether they want to go to the previous page, save the form or go to the next page.
An imperative approach to this problem might yield code similar to the following:
public class SomeController { public ActionResult TheAction(string whichButton, UserData userData) { if(whichButton == &amp;quot;Back&amp;quot;) { // do the back action } else if(whichButton == &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot;) { // do the next action } else if(whichButton == &amp;quot;Save&amp;quot;) { // do the save action } throw Exception(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;); } }  A neat design idea which my colleague Dermot Kilroy introduced on our project is the idea of using a dictionary to map to the different actions instead of using if statements.</description>

      <description>Phil wrote an interesting post recently about the Ubuntu decision making process with respect to design and suggested that we should look to follow something similar on agile software development teams.
The Ubuntu design process basically comes down to this:
 This is not a democracy. Good feedback, good data, are welcome. But we are not voting on design decisions.  Phil suggests the following:
 That doesn’t mean that there is an Architect (capital A, please), designing the system for the less-skilled developers to write.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve previously written about the danger of using velocity as a goal but on almost every project I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on at some stage we do actually end up chasing a points total.
Something I find quite interesting towards the end of an iteration is that if there is a choice of two stories to pick up then the project manager will nearly always press for one which can be completed within the remaining time in order to get the points total for that iteration higher.</description>

      <description>I recently came across the idea of tacit programming which is described as such:
 Tacit programming is a programming paradigm in which a function definition does not include information regarding its arguments, using combinators and function composition (but not λ-abstraction) instead of variables. The simplicity behind this idea allows its use on several programming languages, such as J programming language and APL and especially in stack or concatenative languages, such as PostScript, Forth, Joy or Factor.</description>

      <description>Pat Kua recently wrote a retrospective of his time working at ThoughtWorks and since I recently finished the first project I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on in 2010 I thought it would be interesting to have a look at what I&amp;rsquo;d learned and observed while working on it.
&amp;ldquo;Perfect&amp;rdquo; code I&amp;rsquo;ve previously believed that driving for the cleanest code with the least duplication and best structured object oriented design was the way to go but on this project we favoured a simpler design which felt quite procedural in comparison to some of the code bases I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on.</description>

 That whole &#34;Auto Mocking Containers encourage sloppy design&#34; meme that I blew off last week? Seeing an example in our code.  I haven&amp;rsquo;t used an auto mocking container but it seems to me that although that type of tool might be useful for reducing the amount of code we have to write in our tests it also hides the actual problem that we have - an object has too many dependencies.</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time over the weekend coding a simple generic builder for test objects in F# and I noticed that although there were similarity with the ways I drive code in C# or Java my approach didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be exactly the same.
I&amp;rsquo;ve previously written about the importance of getting quick feedback when programming and how I believe that this can often be achieved faster by using the REPL rather than unit testing.</description>

      <description>I wrote a post a while ago about keeping consistency in the code base where I covered some of the reasons that you might want to rewrite parts of a code base and the potential impact of those changes but an interesting side to this discussion which I didn&amp;rsquo;t cover that much but which seems to play a big role is the role of incremental refactoring.
In our code base we recently realised that the naming of the fields in some parts of a form don&amp;rsquo;t really make sense and I wanted to start naming new fields with the new naming style and then go back and change the existing ones incrementally when it was a good time to do so.</description>

      <description>A couple of days I wrote about a &amp;lsquo;returning&amp;rsquo; function that I&amp;rsquo;d written to simplify a bit of F# code that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.
It&amp;rsquo;s defined like so:
let returning t f = f(t); t  And can then be used like this:
let build (t:Type) = returning (Activator.CreateInstance(t)) (fun t -&amp;gt; t.GetType().GetProperties() |&amp;gt; Array.iter (fun p -&amp;gt; p.SetValue(t, createValueFor p, null)))  While I quite like this function it didn&amp;rsquo;t quite feel like idiomatic F# to me.</description>

      <description>Although I&amp;rsquo;m generally quite opposed to coding approaches whereby we mutate objects, sometimes the way a framework is designed seems to make this a preferable option.
We came across a situation like this last week when we wanted to hydrate an object with data coming back from the browser.
The signature of the action in question looked like this:
public class SomeController { public ActionResult SomeAction(string id, UserData userData) { }  We were able to automatically bind most of the values onto &amp;lsquo;UserData&amp;rsquo; except for the &amp;lsquo;id&amp;rsquo; which was coming in from the URL.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s described like so:
Kxy = x  The Kestrel function would take in 2 arguments and return the value of the first one. The second argument would probably be a function that takes in the first argument and then performs some side effects with that value.</description>

The problem we were trying to solve was around the validation of some dependent fields and to start with we had this requirement:</description>

      <description>I was recently reading a blog post by Esko Luontola where he talks about the direct and indirect effects of TDD and one particularly interesting point he makes is that driving our code with a TDD approach helps to amplify the problems caused by writing bad code.
 if the code is not maintainable, it will be hard to change. Also if the code is not testable, it will be hard to write tests for it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve previously written about some approaches that I&amp;rsquo;ve been taught with respect to taking small steps when refactoring code and another approach which a couple of colleagues have been using recently is the idea of overloading the constructor when refactoring objects.
On a couple of occasions we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to completely change the way an object was designed and changing the current constructor would mean that we&amp;rsquo;d have to change all the tests against that object before checking if the new design was actually going to work or not.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to follow the &amp;lsquo;Monads for Java/C++ programmers&amp;rsquo; post in ghci and getting the following type of error when trying out the code snippets:
Prelude&amp;gt; a = 3 &amp;lt;interactive&amp;gt;:1:2: parse error on input `=&#39;  I figured there must be something wrong with my installation of the compiler since I was copying and pasting the example across and having this problem. Having reinstalled that, however, I still had the same problem.</description>

      <description>We recently ran into an interesting problem when running the website we&amp;rsquo;re building on our &amp;lsquo;user replica machine&amp;rsquo; where you can access the application via a web browser running on Citrix.
The problem we were having was that the result of a post redirect get request that we were making via the jQuery Form plugin was failing to update the fragment of the page correctly. It looked like it was replacing it with the original HTML.</description>

      <description>I wrote previously about how we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some calculations on my current project and one thing we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to do is write this code in a fairly declarative way.
Since we&amp;rsquo;ve been test driving the code it initially started off being quite imperative and looked a bit like this:
public class TheCalculator { ... public double CalculateFrom(UserData userData) { return Calculation1(userData) + Calculation2(userData) + Calculation3(userData); } public double Calculation1(UserData userData) { // do calculation stuff here } public double Calculation2(UserData userData) { // do calculation stuff here } .</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about my thoughts on outside in development and we came across another example last week where we made our life difficult by not initially following this approach.
The rough design of what we were working on looked like this:
My pair and I were working on the code to do the calculations and we deliberately chose not to drive the functionality from the UI because the other pair were reworking all our validation code and we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to step on each others toes.</description>

      <description>John Daniels has an interesting post summarising GOOSgaggle, an event run a few weeks ago where people met up to talk about the ideas in &amp;lsquo;Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided by Tests&amp;rsquo;.
It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting post and towards the end he states the following:
 Given these two compelling justifications for starting with end-to-end tests, why is it that many people apparently don&#39;t start there? We came up with two possibilities, although there may be many others:  Starting with the domain model can provide an illusion of rapid progress.</description>

      <description>One of the problems that I&amp;rsquo;ve frequently run into when writing C# code in a more functional way is that we can often end up with &amp;lsquo;Funcs&amp;rsquo; all over the place which don&amp;rsquo;t really describe what concept they&amp;rsquo;re encapsulating.
We had some code similar to this where it wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely obvious what the Func being stored in the dictionary was actually doing:
public class Calculator { private Dictionary&amp;lt;string, Func&amp;lt;double, double, double&amp;gt;&amp;gt; lookups = new Dictionary&amp;lt;string, Func&amp;lt;double, double, double&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(); public Blah() { lookups.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been writing quite a bit of code on my current project trying to encapsulate user selected values from drop down menus where we then want to go and look up something in another system based on the value that they select.
Essentially we have the need for some of the things that a Java Enum would give us but which a C# one doesn&amp;rsquo;t!
Right now we have several classes similar to the following in our code base to achieve this:</description>

      <description>Continuing with our learning with Mercurial, yesterday we wanted to revert a couple of change sets that we had previously committed and go back to an old version of the code and continue working from there.
As an example, say we wanted to go back to Revision 1 and had the following changes committed:
Revision 3 Revision 2 Revision 1 Revision 0  My original thought was that we could merge revision 1 with the current tip:</description>

      <description>On the project I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on we have several stories around writing the code that does various different calculations based on user input and then shows the results on the screen.
The original assumption on these stories was that we would be looking up the data of the business rules from a local database. The data would be copied across from a central database into that one for this project.</description>

      <description>My colleagues Frankie and Danilo have been recommending &amp;lsquo;Maverick&amp;rsquo; to me for a long time and I finally got around to reading it.
In this book Ricardo Semler, the CEO of Semco, tells the story of the company and how he helped evolved the organisation into one which is more employee led and embraces ideas such as open &amp;amp; self set salaries while encouraging civil obedience in the workforce as a necessity to alert the organisation to its problems.</description>

      <description>While reading through an old blog post by Matthew Podwysocki about writing F# code in a functional rather than imperative way I came across the &amp;lsquo;defaultArg&amp;rsquo; function which I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen previously.
It&amp;rsquo;s quite a simple function that we can use when we want to set a default value if an option type has a value of &amp;lsquo;None&amp;rsquo;:
The type signature is as follows:
&amp;gt; defaultArg;; val it : (&#39;a option -&amp;gt; &#39;a -&amp;gt; &#39;a) = &amp;lt;fun:clo@0&amp;gt;  And the definition is relatively simple:</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re using Mercurial as our source control system on the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on at the moment and since I&amp;rsquo;ve not yet used a distributed source control system on a team I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be interesting to note some of my initial thoughts.
One of the neat things about having a local repository and a central one is that you can check in lots of times locally and then push those changes to the central repository when you want everyone else to get the changes that you&amp;rsquo;ve made.</description>

      <description>On the project I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on my colleague Christian Blunden has introduced a version of the Maybe type into the code base, a concept that originally derives from the world of functional programming.
The code looks a bit like this:
public interface Maybe&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; { bool HasValue(); T Value(); }	 public class Some&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; : Maybe&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; { private readonly T t; public Some(T t) { this.t = t; } public bool HasValue() {	return true; } public T Value() {	return t; }	}  public class None&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; : Maybe&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; { public bool HasValue() {	return false; } public T Value() {	throw new NotImplementedException(); }	}  We would then use it in the code like this:</description>

      <description>One of the general guidelines that I like to follow when writing methods is trying to ensure that it&amp;rsquo;s only doing one thing but on several recent projects I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed us breaking this guideline and it feels like the right thing to do.
The method in question typically takes in some user details, looks up that user in some data store and then returning it if there is an existing user and creating a new user if not.</description>

      <description>Grant Joung wrote a post a while ago about velocity goals and whether they&amp;rsquo;re a good or bad idea, a topic which seems to come up from time to time on agile teams.
My colleague Danilo Sato previously wrote about the dangers of using velocity as a performance measure because it&amp;rsquo;s something that&amp;rsquo;s directly within our control and can therefore be gamed:
 Value should be measured at the highest level possible, so that it doesn’t fall into one team’s (or individual’s) span of control.</description>

It describes the way that he was able to help change the company culture from one where he made all the decisions and took all responsibility to one where everyone in the company was involved in decision making, resulting in a more successful organisation.</description>

      <description>As part of our continuous integration build we have a step in the build which tears down a Windows service, uninstalls it and then reinstalls it later on from the latest files checked into the repository.
One problem we&amp;rsquo;ve been having recently is that despite the fact it should already have been uninstalled a lock has been kept on the log4net dll in our build directory, a directory that we tear down as one of the next steps.</description>

To summarise, J.K.&amp;rsquo;s current approach involves moving from the traditional story format of:

      <description>A fairly common scenario that we come across when building automated test suites using Selenium is the need to get past the security exception that Firefox pops up when you try to access a self signed HTTPS page.
Luckily there is quite a cool plugin for Firefox called &amp;lsquo;Remember Certificate Exception&amp;rsquo; which automatically clicks through the exception and allows the automated tests to keep running and not get stuck on the certificate exception page.</description>

While tidying up the tests after we&amp;rsquo;d got them passing we noticed that the test structure wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly the same. The two tests looked a bit like this:
[Test] public void ShouldSetSomethingIfWeHaveAFoo() { var aFoo = FooBuilder.Build.WithBar(&amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;).WithBaz(&amp;quot;baz&amp;quot;).AFoo(); // some random setup // some stubs/expectations var result = new Controller(.</description>

On one of our screens we have some questions that the user fills in which read a bit like this:
 Do you have a foo?  Is your foo an approved foo? Is your foo special?    i.e. you would only see the 2nd and 3rd questions on the screen if you answered yes to the first question.</description>

      <description>Towards the end of a post I wrote just over a year ago I suggested that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really bothered about test names anymore because I could learn what I wanted from reading the test body.
Recently, however, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across several tests that I wrote previously which were testing the wrong thing and had such generic test names that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious that it was happening.
The tests in question were around code which partially clones an object but doesn&amp;rsquo;t copy some fields for various reasons.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Neal Ford&amp;rsquo;s series of articles on Evolutionary architecture and emergent design and in the one about &amp;lsquo;Investigating architecture and design&amp;rsquo; he discusses Essential and accidental complexity which I&amp;rsquo;ve previously read about in Neal&amp;rsquo;s book, &amp;lsquo;The Productive Programmer&amp;rsquo;.
Neal defines these terms like so:
 Essential complexity is the core of the problem we have to solve, and it consists of the parts of the software that are legitimately difficult problems.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a bit of time working with Les recently and it&amp;rsquo;s been quite interesting working out the best way for us to pair together as he&amp;rsquo;s working as a front end developer on the team which means he&amp;rsquo;s best utilised working on the CSS/JavaScript/HTML side of things.
Having said that there are often features which require both front end and backend collaboration and we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to drive these features from the front end through to the backend rather than working on the backend code separately and then working with Les later on to hook it all up to the frontend.</description>

      <description>I recently came across node.js via a blog post by Paul Gross and I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with it a bit over the weekend trying to hook up some code to call through to the Twitter API and then return the tweets on my friend timeline.
node.js gives us event driven I/O using JavaScript running server side on top of Google&amp;rsquo;s V8 JavaScript engine.
Simon Willison has part of a presentation on slideshare where he describes the difference between the typical thread per request approach and the event based approach to dealing with web requests using the metaphor of bunnies.</description>

      <description>Despite the fact that none of the projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on have used Git or Mercurial as the team&amp;rsquo;s main repository I keep forgetting how useful those tools can be even if they&amp;rsquo;re just being used locally.
I ran into a problem when trying to work out why a Rhino Mocks expectation wasn&amp;rsquo;t working as I expected last week having refactored a bit of code to include a constructor.</description>

      <description>James Shore has an interesting recent blog post where he describes some alternatives to over reliance on acceptance testing and one of the ideas that he describes is fixing the process whenever a bug is found in exploratory testing.
He describes two ways of preventing bugs from making it through to exploratory testing:
 Make the bug impossible Catch the bug automatically   Sometimes we can prevent defects by changing the design of our system so that type of defect is impossible.</description>

      <description>Alan Atlas has a recent blog post where he discusses agile, lean and scrum and suggests that you can&amp;rsquo;t truly achieve agility unless your company is fully committed to it which differs slightly from my experiences.
Alan makes a valid point that we&amp;rsquo;re not really following an approach just because we use all the practices:
 Many people make the mistake of viewing Scrum and Agile and Lean as sets of practices.</description>

      <description>My colleague John Hume wrote an interesting post about his experience with the &amp;lsquo;const&amp;rsquo; keyword in ActionScript where he describes the problems with trying to capture a loop variable in a closure and then evaluating it later on in the code.
Since ActionScript and JavaScript are both dialects of ECMAscript, this is a problem in JavaScript as well, and is due to the fact that variables in JavaScript have function scope rather than block scope which is the case in many other languages.</description>

      <description>Mark Wilden pointed me to a post he&amp;rsquo;s written about his experience pair programming at Pivotal Labs where he makes some interesting although not uncommon observations.
 When you pair program, you&#39;re effectively joined at the hip with your pair. You can&#39;t pair if only one of you is there.  I&amp;rsquo;ve previously written wondering what we should do if our pair isn&amp;rsquo;t around where I was leaning more towards the opinion that we should try to continue along the same path that we were on when working with our pair if they&amp;rsquo;re gone for a short amount of time and to find a new pair or work alone if they&amp;rsquo;re gone for longer.</description>

These are some of my favourite parts:

      <description>I came across an interesting post by John Resig where he describes a &amp;lsquo;makeClass&amp;rsquo; function that he uses in his code to create functions which can instantiate objects regardless of whether the user calls that function with or without the new keyword.
The main reason that the new keyword seems to be considered harmful is because we might make assumptions in our function that it will be called with the new keyword which changes the meaning of &amp;lsquo;this&amp;rsquo; inside that function.</description>

      <description>An interesting problem which I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a few times recently is where we have two collections which we want to use together in some way and get a result which could either be another collection or some other value.
In one which Chris and I were playing around with we had a collection of years and a collection of cars with corresponding years and the requirement was to show all the years on the page with the first car we found for that year or an empty value if there was no car for that year.</description>

The idea with outside in development as I understand it is that we would look to drive any new functionality from the UI i.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of my time working on agile software development teams over the last few years so for the most part each pair is only working on one story, keeping the work in progress low and allowing them to focus on that piece of work until it&amp;rsquo;s completed.
My pair and I ended up in a therefore somewhat unusual situation last week where we were attempting to work on three things at the same time and weren&amp;rsquo;t doing a particularly great job on any of them.</description>

      <description>I wrote a couple of weeks ago about using the &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;apply&amp;rsquo; functions in Javascript when passing functions around and while working on our IE6 specific code I realised that I&amp;rsquo;d got them mixed up.
We were writing some code to override one of our functions so that we could call the original function and then do something else after that.
The code was roughly like this:
Foo = { bar : function(duck) { console.</description>

      <description>One thing we&amp;rsquo;ve found on my current project is that despite our best efforts we&amp;rsquo;ve still ended up with some javascript code which we only want to run if the user is using Internet Explorer 6 and the question then becomes how to write that code so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t end up being spread all over the application.
jQuery has some functions which allow you to work out which browser&amp;rsquo;s being used but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that when we use those you tend to end up with if statements dotted all around the code which isn&amp;rsquo;t so good.</description>

 Quoting Jeff Sutherland:  Only when you have mastered the basic practices are you allowed to improvise. And the last and most important – Before you have gained discipline, centering, and flexibility, you are a hazard to yourself and others.</description>

      <description>On a few projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on one of the things that we&amp;rsquo;ve done is create a shared library of objects which can be used across several different projects and while at the time it seemed like a good idea, in hindsight I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s an entirely successful strategy.
I&amp;rsquo;m quite a fan of not recreating effort which is generally the goal when trying to pull out common code and within one team this seems to be a good approach the majority of the time.</description>

      <description>I came across a couple of quite interesting blog posts recently which described some approaches to interviewing which suggest a more empirical approach to interviewing whereby the interview is treated more like an audition for the person being interviewed.
I like this idea and it&amp;rsquo;s something that we do when recruiting developers in a pair programming interview.
The general idea is that we pair with the candidate as they go through a coding problem.</description>

At this stage in the past I&amp;rsquo;ve often then stopped and left the refactoring until I have more time to complete it but this hasn&amp;rsquo;t really worked and a lot of the time I end up only seeing the code change in my mind and not in the actual code.</description>

I was fairly sure one of the object&amp;rsquo;s in our code base was doing too many things due to the fact that it had a lot of dependencies.</description>

I thought I knew the language well enough to be able to do this kata quite easily so I was quite surprised at how much I struggled initially.
These are some of my observations from this exercise:
 I was using screw-unit as my unit testing framework - I originally tried to setup JSTestDriver but I was having problems getting that to work so in the interests of not shaving the yak I decided to go with something I already know how to use.</description>

      <description>I recently came across an interesting bit of code which was going through a collection of strings and then only taking the first &amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo; number of characters and discarding the rest.
The code looked roughly like this:
var words = new[] {&amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;to&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;world&amp;quot;}; var newWords = new List&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;(); foreach (string word in words) { if (word.Length &amp;gt; 3) { newWords.Add(word.Substring(0, 3)); continue; } newWords.Add(word); }  For this initial collection of words we would expect &amp;lsquo;newWords&amp;rsquo; to contain [&amp;ldquo;hel&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;to&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;the&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;wor&amp;rdquo;]</description>

      <description>One of the things I find most confusing when reading about programming languages is the idea of covariance and contravariance and while I&amp;rsquo;ve previously read that covariance is not possible when using generics in C# I recently came across an example where I saw that this was true.
I came across this problem while looking at how to refactor some code which has been written in an imperative style:
public interface IFoo { string Bar { get; set; } } public class Foo : IFoo { public string Bar { get; set; } }  private IEnumerable&amp;lt;IFoo&amp;gt; GetMeFoos() { var someStrings = new[] { &amp;quot;mike&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;mark&amp;quot; }; var someFoos = new List&amp;lt;IFoo&amp;gt;(); foreach (var s in someStrings) { someFoos.</description>

I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try to make use of functional collection parameters to try and simplify the code a bit but actually ended up breaking one of the tests.
About a month ago I wrote about how I&amp;rsquo;d written a hand rolled stub to simplify a test and this was actually where I caused myself the problem!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written previously about function overloading in F# and my struggles working out how to do it and last week I came across the concept of inline functions and statically resolved parameters as a potential way to solve that problem.
I came across a problem where I thought I would be able to make use of this while playing around with some code parsing Xml today.
I had a &amp;lsquo;descendants&amp;rsquo; function which I wanted to be applicable against &amp;lsquo;XDocument&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;XElement&amp;rsquo; so I originally just defined the functions separately forgetting that the compiler wouldn&amp;rsquo;t allow me to do so as we would have a duplicate definition of the function:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with some F# code this evening and one of the bits of code needs to make a HTTP call and return the result.
I wrote this code and then tried to make use of the &amp;lsquo;Async.RunSynchronously&amp;rsquo; function to execute the call.
The code I had looked roughly like this:
namespace Twitter module RetrieveLinks open System.Net open System.IO open System.Web open Microsoft.FSharp.Control let AsyncHttp (url:string) = async { let request = HttpWebRequest.</description>

      <description>I already wrote about how I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a bit about the &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;apply&amp;rsquo; functions in Javascript this week but as I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the majority of my time doing front end stuff this week I&amp;rsquo;ve also learnt and noticed some other things which I thought were quite interesting.
Finding character codes We were doing some testing early in the week where we needed to restrict the characters that could be entered into a text box.</description>

      <description>Having read Douglas Crockford&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Javascript: The Good Parts&amp;rsquo; I was already aware that making use of the &amp;lsquo;this&amp;rsquo; keyword in Javascript is quite dangerous but we came across what must be a fairly common situation this week where we wanted to pass around a function which made use of &amp;lsquo;this&amp;rsquo; internally.
We were writing some JSTestDriver tests around a piece of code which looked roughly like this:
function Common() { this.</description>

      <description>One thing which I&amp;rsquo;ve often wondered when playing around with F# is that when writing the following function the type of the function is inferred to be &amp;lsquo;int -&amp;gt; int -&amp;gt; int&amp;rsquo; rather than allowing any values which can be added together:
let add x y = x + y &amp;gt; val add : int -&amp;gt; int -&amp;gt; int  It turns out if you use the &amp;lsquo;inline&amp;rsquo; keyword then the compiler does exactly what we want:</description>

      <description>We ran into an interesting problem today when moving some Javascript code which was making use of the &amp;lsquo;string.replace&amp;rsquo; function to strip out the £ sign from some text boxes on a form.
The code we had written was just doing this:
var textboxValue = $(&amp;quot;#fieldId&amp;quot;).val().replace(/£/, &#39;&#39;);  So having realised that we had this code all over the place we decided it would make sense to create a common function that strip the pound sign out.</description>

      <description>While working on some code with Toni we realised that we&amp;rsquo;d managed to create two functions that were almost exactly the same except they made different service calls and returned collections of a different type.
The similar functions were like this:
private IEnumerable&amp;lt;Foo&amp;gt; GetFoos(Guid id) { IEnumerable&amp;lt;Foo&amp;gt; foos = new List&amp;lt;Foo&amp;gt;(); try { foos = fooService.GetFoosFor(id); } catch (Exception e) { // do some logging of the exception } return foos; }  private IEnumerable&amp;lt;Bar&amp;gt; GetBars(Guid id) { IEnumerable&amp;lt;Bar&amp;gt; bars = new List&amp;lt;Bar&amp;gt;(); try { bars = barService.</description>

      <description>I came across an interesting post that Roy Osherove wrote a few months ago where he talks about &amp;lsquo;Willed vs Forced Designs&amp;rsquo; and some common arguments that people give for not using TypeMock on their projects.
I&amp;rsquo;m not really a fan of the TypeMock approach to dealing with dependencies in tests because it seems to avoid the fact that the code is probably bad in the first place if we have to resort to using some of the approaches it encourages.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been browsing through Chris Smith&amp;rsquo;s Programming F# book and in the chapter on pattern matching he describes the &amp;lsquo;function&amp;rsquo; key word which I haven&amp;rsquo;t used before.
It&amp;rsquo;s used in pattern matching expressions when we want to match against one of the parameters passed into the function which contains the pattern match.
For example if we have this somewhat contrived example:
let isEven value = match value with | x when (x % 2) = 0 -&amp;gt; true | _ -&amp;gt; false  That could be rewritten using the function keyword to the following:</description>

      <description>One of the common discussions that I&amp;rsquo;ve had with several colleagues when we&amp;rsquo;re making use of some of the higher order functions that can be applied on collections is whether to use the LINQ style syntax or to chain the different methods together.
I tend to prefer the latter approach although when asked the question after my talk at Developer Developer Developer I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a good answer other than to suggest that it seemed to just be a personal preference thing.</description>

      <description>One of the things which Nat Pryce and Steve Freeman suggest in their book Growing Object Oriented Software guided by tests is the idea of wrapping any third party libraries that we use in our own code.
We came across a situation where we did this and then later on I made the mistake of not following this advice.
To start with my colleague David had created a DSL which kept all the calls to Selenium nicely wrapped inside one class.</description>

      <description>One of the more interesting higher order functions that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across while playing with F# is the partition function which is similar to the filter function except it returns the values which meet the predicate passed in as well as the ones which don&amp;rsquo;t.
I came across an interesting problem recently where we needed to do exactly this and had ended up taking a more imperative for each style approach to solve the problem because this function doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in C# as far as I know.</description>

In this chapter they cover various approaches for driving towards object oriented code including techniques to find new objects and a detailed description of TDD and how we can approach this in a way that allows us to drive out new behaviour effectively.</description>

      <description>I wrote about my first thoughts using Automapper last week and although I realised that it makes use of the static gateway pattern we ran into a problem where two consecutive calls to a method using AutoMapper always returned the same value for one of the mappings.
The code was roughly like this:
public Bar CreateNewBar(Bar originalBar, string someNewValue) { Mapper.CreateMap&amp;lt;Baz, Baz&amp;gt;() .ForMember(x =&amp;gt; x.Id, opts =&amp;gt; opts.Ignore()) .ForMember(x =&amp;gt; x.</description>

I worked with Raphael Speyer for a few weeks last year and on the code base we were working on he often spent some time rewriting tests originally written using rMock to use mockito which was the framework we were driving towards.</description>

      <description>I wrote a couple of weeks ago about my thoughts on hand written stubs vs framework generated stubs and I noticed an interesting situation where it helped me out while trying to simplify some test code.
The code in question was making use of several framework generated stubs/mocks and one in particular was trying to return different values depending on the value passed as a parameter.
The test was failing and I spent about half an hour unsuccessfully trying to work out why it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working as expected before I decided to replace it with a hand rolled stub that did exactly what I wanted.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to work out the best way to do this but I came across a really interesting post by J.</description>

      <description>The collecting parameter pattern is one of my favourite ones when used well but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed recently that it can lead to quit misleading APIs as well.
One way that we used it quite effectively was when getting objects to render themselves to a ViewData container which was then used to populate the view.
public class Micro { private string micro; public Micro(string micro) { this.micro = micro; } public void renderTo(ViewData viewData) { viewData.</description>

      <description>I came across Jimmy Bogard&amp;rsquo;s Automapper library a while ago but hadn&amp;rsquo;t had the opportunity to try it out on a project until this week.
The problem we wanted to solve was relatively simple.
We had a domain object and we wanted to create a copy of that with one of the fields changed and all of the ids cleared from the object and any objects contained within it so that we could persist the new web of objects to the database.</description>

 When starting a new area of code, we might temporarily suspend our design judgment and just write code without attempting to impose much structure.  It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that they don&amp;rsquo;t try and write perfect code the first time around which is actually something I thought experienced developers did until I came across Uncle Bob&amp;rsquo;s Clean Code book where he suggested something similar.</description>

In the presentation Evans make some really insightful comments and points out a lot of mistakes that I&amp;rsquo;ve made on projects. It certainly serves as a reminder to go back and read part 4 of the book again and really understand the material from that section.</description>

      <description>Something which I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed quite a lot on the projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on since C# 3.0 was released is that lists seem to be passed around code much more and have LINQ style filters and transformations performed on them while failing to describe the underlying abstraction explcitly in the code.
As a result of this we quite frequently we end up with this code being in multiple places and since it&amp;rsquo;s usually not very much code the repetition goes unnoticed more than other types of duplication might do.</description>

      <description>One of the common tasks that we need to do on every project I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on is ensure that we can create a web.config file for the different environments that we need to deploy our application to.
Nant has quite a neat task called &amp;lsquo;expandproperties&amp;rsquo; which allows us to do this quite easily.
In our build file we would have the following:
build-file.build
&amp;lt;property name =&amp;quot;configFile&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;${environment}.properties&amp;quot; readonly=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;if test=&amp;quot;${not file::exists(configFile)}&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;fail message=&amp;quot;Configuration file &#39;${configFile}&#39; could not be found.</description>

      <description>We were working on some refactoring today where we pushed some logic back from a service and onto a domain object and I noticed that we were able to use functions quite effectively to reduce the amount of code we had to write while still describing differences in behaviour.
The class we want to write needs to take in two integers which represent two different situations related to Foo. Depending upon whether we have &amp;lsquo;Situation 1&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Situation 2&amp;rsquo; or both situations we will display the results slightly differently.</description>

I wrote previously about my thoughts of where to use each of the two approaches and one example of where hand written stubs seems to make sense is the clock.</description>

      <description>A few months ago Uncle Bob wrote a post about TDD where he suggested that he preferred to use hand created stubs in his tests wherever possible and only resorted to using a Mockito created stub as a last resort.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tended to use framework created ones but my colleague Matt Dunn and I noticed that it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work out too well for us writing some tests around a controller where the majority of our tests were making exactly the same call to that repository and expected to receive the same return value but a few select edge cases expected something different.</description>

      <title>F#: Refactoring to sequence/for expressions</title>

      <description>Since I started playing around with F# one of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to do is not use the &amp;lsquo;for&amp;rsquo; keyword because I was trying to avoid writing code in an imperative way and for loops are a big part of this for me.
Having read Jon Harrop&amp;rsquo;s solution to the word count problem where he made use of both sequence and for expressions I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be intersting to see what some of the code I&amp;rsquo;ve written would look like using that approach.</description>

      <title>C# Test Builder Pattern: My current thinking</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written previously about the test builder pattern in C# and having noticed some different implementations of this pattern I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be interesting to post my current thinking on how to use it.
One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is that we often end up just creating methods which effectively act as setters rather than easing the construction of an object.
This seems to happen most commonly when the value we want to set is a boolean value.</description>

      <description>I was looking through some of the F# code I&amp;rsquo;ve written recently and I realised that I was very much writing C# in F# with respect to the number of if statements I&amp;rsquo;ve been using.
I thought it would be interesting to see what the code would look like if I was able to refactor some of that code to make use of pattern matching instead which would be a more idiomatic way of solving the problem in F#.</description>

      <description>I wrote previously about my dislike of C#&amp;rsquo;s object initializer syntax and while I still think those arguments hold I came across an interesting argument for why it is a useful feature in Jeremy Miller&amp;rsquo;s MSDN article on creating internal DSLs in C#.
In the article Jeremy works through an example where he builds up a &amp;lsquo;SendMessageRequest&amp;rsquo; first by using a fluent interface and then by making use of object initializer syntax.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in a few of my recent posts I&amp;rsquo;ve been having another go at Roy Osherove&amp;rsquo;s TDD Kata but this time in F#.
One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with when coding in F# is working out how many intermediate variables we actually need. They can be useful for expressing intent better but they&amp;rsquo;re clutter in a way.
I&amp;rsquo;ve included my solution at the end and in the active pattern which determines whether or not we have a custom delimeter defined in our input string I can&amp;rsquo;t decide whether or not to create a value to represent the expressions that determine that.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with more F# code and after realising that I&amp;rsquo;d peppered the code with if statements I thought it would be interesting to try and refactor it to make use of active patterns.
The code is part of my F# solution to Roy Osherove&amp;rsquo;s TDD Kata and is used to parse the input string and find which delimeters are being used.
This is the original code:
let hasCustomDelimeter (value:string) = value.</description>

      <description>A fairly common discussion that I&amp;rsquo;ve had with several of my colleagues is around the way that we name the variables used for mocks and stubs in our tests.
There seems to be about a 50&amp;frasl;50 split between including &amp;lsquo;Stub&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Mock&amp;rsquo; on the end of those variable names and not doing so.
In a simple example test using Rhino Mocks as the testing framework this would be the contrast between the two approaches:</description>

      <description>In my continued efforts at Roy Osherove&amp;rsquo;s TDD Kata I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to work out how to split a string based on a delimeter which contains more than one character.
My original thinking was that it should be possible to do so like this:
&amp;quot;1***2&amp;quot;.Split(&amp;quot;***&amp;quot;.ToCharArray());;  I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise that splitting the string like that splits on each of the stars individually which means that we end up getting 2 empty values in the result:</description>

      <description>A while ago I wrote about F#&amp;rsquo;s forward and application operators where I&amp;rsquo;d looked at how these could be used to simplify code and while trying out Roy Osherove&amp;rsquo;s TDD Kata I realised that perhaps the choice of which of these to use or whether to use them at all depends on what intent we&amp;rsquo;re expressing.
The specific bit of code I was writing was for raising an exception if negative values were provided and I originally thought I&amp;rsquo;d use the forward operator to express this code:</description>

These were some of the parts that particularly stood out for me:

      <description>A few months ago I wrote a post describing how we should test the behaviour of code rather than the implementation whereby we would write tests against the public API of an object rather than exposing other internal data of the object and testing against that directly.
While I still think this is a useful way of testing code I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a good definition for what makes that a test of an object&amp;rsquo;s behaviour.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve only done the first part of the exercise so far which is as follows:</description>

      <description>David Agans&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Debugging&amp;rsquo; is the best debugging book that I&amp;rsquo;ve read so I was intrigued to see that there was another book being written on the subject.
Paul Butcher offered me a copy of the book to review so I was keen to see whether it was more like &amp;lsquo;Debugging&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Release It&amp;rsquo; as Ted Neward suggests.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m reading through Paul Butcher&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Debug It&amp;rsquo; book and one of his suggestions when trying to diagnose a problem in our code is to only change one thing at a time.
In a way this might seem fairly obvious but I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly fallen into the trap of making multiple changes at the same time in the misled belief that it&amp;rsquo;ll lead to the problem being solved more quickly.
When making changes to code Butcher has the following piece of advice which I quite like:  Once you see a change in behavior, undo whatever apparently caused it, and verify that the behavior retur ns to what it was before-hand.</description>

Using the &amp;lsquo;use&amp;rsquo; keyword means that the &amp;lsquo;Dispose&amp;rsquo; method will be called on the resource when it goes out of scope.
The two examples were &amp;lsquo;StreamWriter&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;StreamReader&amp;rsquo;:</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a transcript of a talk that Richard Hamming gave to Bellcore employees at the Morris Research and Engineering Centre in 1986.
The talk is aimed at computer science researchers and Hamming describes ways for them to do the best research that they can. I think several of the ideas in the talk relate to software development as well.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Michl Henning&amp;rsquo;s post on API design and one thing which he points out is that it&amp;rsquo;s important to drive the design of an API based on the way that it will be used by its clients:
 A great way to get usable APIs is to let the customer (namely, the caller) write the function signature, and to give that signature to a programmer to implement. This step alone eliminates at least half of poor APIs: too often, the implementers of APIs never use their own creations, with disastrous consequences for usability  This is similar to Michael Feathers&amp;rsquo; Golden Rule of API Design:</description>

The solution needs to count word frequencies from a selection of newsgroup articles.
I wanted to see if it was possible to write it in F# without using a map to keep track of how many of each word had been found.</description>

On a few projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on where we didn&amp;rsquo;t have a common understanding of what different concepts in the domain should be I noticed that there was a reluctance to make changes to class names.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not that bothered what the name is but I was reading the transcript of Fred Brooks&amp;rsquo; acceptance speech for winning the ACM Allen Newell Award in 1994 titled &amp;lsquo;The Computer Scientist as Toolsmith&amp;rsquo; which has some interesting ideas about what our role should be.</description>

One interesting suggestion he has around 37 minutes in is that when learning a new language it might be a good idea to contact someone who&amp;rsquo;s an expert in that language and get some framing knowledge on the type of stuff that&amp;rsquo;s worth learning and what we might not bother with.</description>

      <description>Liz recently posted about mock objects and the original &amp;lsquo;mock roles, not objects&amp;rsquo; paper and one thing that stood out for me is the idea that we should only mock types that we own.
I think this is quite an important guideline to follow otherwise we can end up in a world of pain.
One area which seems particularly vulnerable to this type of thing is when it comes to testing code which interacts with Hibernate.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m up to the chapter on using macros in Stuart Halloway&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Programming Clojure&amp;rsquo; book and since I&amp;rsquo;ve never used a language which has macros in before I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be cool to write one.
In reality there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to create a macro to do what I want to do but I wanted to keep the example simple so I could try and understand exactly how macros work.
I want to create a macro which takes in one argument and then prints hello and the person&amp;rsquo;s name.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with macros over the last few days and while writing a simple one forgot to include the brackets to make it evaluate correctly:
(defmacro say-hello [person] println &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; person)  This macro doesn&amp;rsquo;t even expand like I thought it would:
user=&amp;gt; (macroexpand-1 &#39;(say-hello blah)) blah  That seemed a bit strange to me but I eventually realised that I&amp;rsquo;d missed off the brackets around &amp;lsquo;println&amp;rsquo; and the arguments following it which would have resulted in &amp;lsquo;println&amp;rsquo; being evaluated with those arguments.</description>

      <description>About a month ago or so Gary Bernhardt wrote a post showing how to get started with TDD and while the post is quite interesting, several comments on the post pointed out that he had jumped from iteratively solving the problem straight to the solution with his final step.
Something which I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed while solving algorithmic problems in couple of different functional programming languages is that the test driven approach doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so well for these types of problems.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m reading through John Hughes&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Why functional programming matters&amp;rsquo; paper and one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve come across which is a bit counter intuitive to me is the Haskell function composition operator.
I&amp;rsquo;ve written previously about F#&amp;rsquo;s function composition operator which is defined as follows:
let inline (&amp;gt;&amp;gt;) f g x = g(f x)  To write a function which doubled all the values in a list and then returned the odd values we&amp;rsquo;d do this:</description>

      <description>In my continued playing around with Clojure I came across the &amp;lsquo;when-let&amp;rsquo; macro.
&amp;lsquo;when-let&amp;rsquo; is used when we want to bind an expression to a symbol and only execute the body provided as the second argument to the macro if that symbol evaluates to true.
As I wrote previously, a value of &amp;lsquo;false&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;nil&amp;rsquo; would result in the second argument not being evaluated.
A simple example of using &amp;lsquo;when-let&amp;rsquo; would be:</description>

      <description>Oredev have put some of the videos from the conference on Vimeo and one of my favourites is &amp;lsquo;Our obsession with efficiency&amp;rsquo; by my colleague Dan North.
The slides for the talk are available on SlideShare.
In this talk Dan leads from the following statement about efficiency:
 So here&#39;s the thing, I don&#39;t believe in efficiency. It&#39;s our obsession with efficiency that has got us into the current technology mess, and which has led almost directly to heavy waterfall processes.</description>

      <description>One thing which I think is great about coding with F# is the quick feedback that we can get by defining and then testing out functions in the REPL.
We can do the same thing in Clojure but it&amp;rsquo;s even better because we can also define and run unit tests which I think is pretty neat.
Nurullah Akkaya has a good post which describes how to use clojure.test, a testing framework written by Stuart Sierra so I&amp;rsquo;ve been using that to define some tests cases for the little RSS feed parser that I&amp;rsquo;m writing.</description>

      <description>I recently came across an interesting blog post by Rod Hilton on unit testing and it reminded me of a couple of conversations Phil, Raph and I were having about the best way to test classes which delegate some responsibility to another class.
An example that we ran into recently was where we wrote some code which required one controller to delegate to another.
public class ControllerOne extends Controller { public ModelAndView handleRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws Exception { } }  public class ControllerTwo extends Controller { private final ControllerOne controllerOne; public ControllerTwo(ControllerOne controllerOne) { this.</description>

      <description>In my continued playing around with Clojure I came across the &amp;lsquo;apply&amp;rsquo; function which is used when we want to call another function with a number of arguments but have actually been given a single argument which contains the argument list.
The example that I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to understand is applying &amp;lsquo;str&amp;rsquo; to a collection of values.
I started off with the following:
(str [1 2 3]) =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;[1 2 3]&amp;quot;  This just returns the string representation of the vector that we passed it, but what we actually want is to get an output of &amp;ldquo;123&amp;rdquo;.</description>

In this chapter Feathers outlines some of the problems we might have getting methods under test and then suggests some ways to get around those problems.
These are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the chapter:
 I quite like the idea of pragmatic refactoring that Feathers suggests early on in the chapter: Ideally, it would be great to break it down into smaller classes, but we have to carefully consider whether we want to do that much refactoring right now.</description>

      <description>A function that we had to write in Java on a project that I worked on recently needed to indicate whether there was a gap in a series of data points or not.
If there were gaps at the beginning or end of the sequence then that was fine but gaps in the middle of the sequence were not.
null, 1, 2, 3 =&amp;gt; no gaps 1, 2, 3, null =&amp;gt; no gaps 1, null, 2, 3 =&amp;gt; gaps  The Java version looked a bit like this:</description>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2009/11/23/requirements-the-story-points-focus/</guid>
      <description>Something which an agile approach on a project typically gives us is the ability to change requirements rapidly based on the different types of feedback we typically get over the course of the project.
One way that we can lose this advantage is by getting caught up by the number of story points being completed and using this as the measure of success.
The flexibility to change has an impact on the number of story points that may be completed in a given iteration - if we start doing some work on a story and then get feedback from the business while it is still in progress it&amp;rsquo;s possible that we will end up with more work to do than we had previously.</description>

      <description>Dan North has been presenting his &amp;lsquo;Pimp my architecture&amp;rsquo; talk again at QCon San Francisco this week and after reading the hugely positive feedback on Twitter I decided to watch some of it again.
The idea of getting people to help each other rather than pair program is what stood out for me this time, something which Brian Guthrie also pointed out:
 &#34;We didn&#39;t do pairing, we did &#39;helping&#39;. You can&#39;t get alpha progs to &#39;pair&#39; but they&#39;ll tell you what they know.</description>

      <description>Something which I wanted to do recently was write a function that would indicate whether a collection contained a nil value.
I initially incorrectly thought the &amp;lsquo;contains?&amp;rsquo; function was the one that I wanted:
(contains? &#39;(1 nil 2 3) nil) =&amp;gt; false  I thought it would work the same as the Java equivalent but that function actually checks whether a key exists in a collection rather than a value. It&amp;rsquo;s more useful when dealing with maps.</description>

      <description>In my continued playing with Clojure I&amp;rsquo;m noticing a few things that I keep getting confused about.
The meaning of parentheses Much like Keith Bennett I&#39;m not used to parentheses playing such an important role in the way that an expression gets evaluated. As I understand it if an expression is enclosed in parentheses then that means it will be evaluated as a function. For example I spent quite a while trying to work out why the following code kept throwing a class cast exception: ~~~lisp (if (true) 1 0) ~~~ If you run that code in the REPL you&#39;ll get the following exception because &#39;true&#39; isn&#39;t a function and therefore can&#39;t be applied as such: ~~~text java.</description>

      <description>An interesting object orientation related problem that Raph and I were looking at recently revolved around the design of two controllers in the application we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.
The two controllers in question look roughly like this:
public class GenericController extends Controller { private final SomeFactory someFactory; public GenericController(SomeFactory someFactory); this.someFactory = someFactory; } public ModelAndView handleRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws Exception { // do some stuff but never use &#39;request&#39; or &#39;response&#39; } }  public class MoreSpecificController extends GenericController { private final SomeFactory someFactory; public MoreSpecificController(SomeFactory someFactory); super(someFactory); } public ModelAndView handleRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws Exception { .</description>

 I think one thing that&#39;s really important is not to be afraid of your ignorance. If you don&#39;t understand how something works, ask someone who does. A lot of people are skittish about that. And that doesn&#39;t help anybody. Not knowing something doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re dumb - it just means you don&#39;t know it yet.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working through Stuart Halloway&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Programming Clojure&amp;rsquo; book and I just got to the section where it first mentions recursive functions.
It&amp;rsquo;s a simple function to countdown from a given number to zero and then return that sequence.
This was one of the examples from the book:
(defn countdown [result x] (if (zero? x) result (recur (conj result x) (dec x))))  That function could then be called like this:</description>

      <description>Alongside taking a break from it perhaps one of the most effective ways to solve a tricky problem is to describe it to someone else.
When pairing This typically isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem when pair programming although it can still happen if a pair stays together too long and both start making the same possibly incorrect assumptions when trying to solve a problem.
In this case it makes sense to call someone else over who can lend a fresh perspective to the problem.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about my favoured approach of writing tests in such a way that they have clear &amp;lsquo;Given/When/Then&amp;rsquo; sections and something which I come across quite frequently is tests where the latter steps have been combined into one method call which takes care of both of these.
An example of this which I came across recently was roughly like this:
@Test public void shouldCalculatePercentageDifferences() { verifyPercentage(50, 100, 100); verifyPercentage(100, 100, 0); verifyPercentage(100, 50, -50); }  private void verifyPercentage(int originalValue, int newValue, int expectedValue) { assertEquals(expectedValue, new PercentageCalculator().</description>

      <description>Amongst the many posts written recently about unit testing one which I quite liked was written by fallenrogue where he describes how in different contexts/cultures a different approach is favoured which means a technique like TDD might not work so well.
cashto, the guy who wrote the original post, agrees with this in the comments on that post:
 Absolutely right. I write apps on mobile devices in C++. What works for me may not work well for someone who designs websites with RoR, and vice versa.</description>

      <description>I was reading a post on the law of demeter by Richard Hart recently and it reminded me that a lot of the refactorings that we typically do on code bases are about pushing the logic back into objects instead of exposing data and performing calculations elsewhere.
An example that I spotted where we did this recently was while building a &amp;lsquo;BusinessSummary&amp;rsquo; object whose state was based on the state of a collection of other objects.</description>

      <description>In &amp;lsquo;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;rsquo; Michael Feathers describes two reasons for wanting to break dependencies in our code - to allow separation and sensing.
The former describes the need to get a piece of code into a test harness while the latter describes the need to assert whether that piece of code is doing what we want it to.
On the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on we&amp;rsquo;ve tended to run into problems with the latter more frequently and Matt and I actually ran into this problem when we were refactoring some code into a role based interface approach.</description>

      <description>I refer quite frequently to a post written by my colleague Peter Gillard Moss where he describes the agent noun code smell for class names.
An agent noun is defined by Wikipedia as:
 In linguistics, an agent noun (or nomen agentis) is a word that is derived from another word denoting an action, and that identifies an entity that does that action.  Some typical examples of this are classes which end in the name &amp;lsquo;Manager&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Retriever&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Helper&amp;rsquo; or even &amp;lsquo;Controller&amp;rsquo; as Carlos points out.</description>

      <description>It strikes me that one of the most important skills to develop in software development is knowing when to keep going with an approach to a problem and when we should stop and try something else.
This situation doesn&amp;rsquo;t always happen because if we have two people available and realise before we start on the task that there is some doubt as to which solution is the most appropriate then we can adopt a set based approach whereby we try out multiple potential solutions in parallel.</description>

      <description>Something which I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed over the last few projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on is that at the beginning when I don&amp;rsquo;t know very much at all about the code base, domain and so on is that pairing with someone to TDD something seems to make it significantly easier for me to follow what&amp;rsquo;s going on than other approaches I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.
I thought that it was probably because I&amp;rsquo;m more used to that approach than any other but in Michael Feathers&amp;rsquo; description of TDD in &amp;lsquo;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;rsquo; he points out the following:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had quite a few discussions with various different colleagues about coding consistency over the last year or so and Pat Kua and Frank Trindade have both written posts suggesting that we should look to have coding standards on projects in order to avoid the type of pain that having an inconsistent approach can lead to.
From what I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed there seem to be two reasons that we end up with inconsistent code on projects:</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time reading some of the Unity code base recently and I decided to try out a variation of Michael Feathers &amp;lsquo;Effect Sketching&amp;rsquo; which my colleague Dave Cameron showed me.
&amp;lsquo;Effect Sketching&amp;rsquo; is a technique Feathers describes in &amp;lsquo;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;rsquo; and the idea is that we sketch a diagram showing the interactions between the fields and methods in a specific class while browsing through the code.</description>

      <description>In our latest technical book club we discussed chapter 8 - &amp;lsquo;How do I add a feature?&amp;rsquo; - of Michael Feather&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;rsquo;.
This chapter covers Test Driven Development and a technique I hadn&amp;rsquo;t come across before called Programming By Difference.
These are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the chapter:
 In the section on TDD Feathers mentions the copy/paste/refactor pattern which I wrote about a few days ago.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re currently reading Michael Feathers &amp;lsquo;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;rsquo; in our technical book club and one interesting technique which he describes in the Test Driven Development section is copying and pasting some existing code, changing the appropriate part to make the test pass before refactoring to remove the duplication we just created.
I can&amp;rsquo;t remember coming across this approach previously but I found myself using it to solve a Scala problem last week.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written a couple of times previously about invariant checking in constructors and I had an interesting discussion with some colleagues recently around doing this type of defensive programming when the object in question has its dependencies injected by a container.
Quite often we would see code similar to this in a controller:
public class SomeController { public SomeController(Dependency1 valueOne, Dependency2 valueTwo) { AssertThat.isNotNull(valueOne); AssertThat.isNotNull(valueTwo); // and so on } }  Where &amp;lsquo;SomeController&amp;rsquo; would have &amp;lsquo;Dependency1&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Dependency2&amp;rsquo; set up in a Spring configuration file in this example.</description>

      <description>I wrote a while ago about reading the ASP.NET MVC source code and noticing that it makes use of code inside its constructors to ensure that null values can&amp;rsquo;t be passed in and while I&amp;rsquo;m still not convinced this is the way to go I think if we do take this approach then we need to ensure we do so consistently.
Something which happens quite often is that you&amp;rsquo;ll come across code which makes use of defensive programming in one of its constructors like so:</description>

Connascence describes the relation between two different bits of code and two bits of code are said to be connascent if a change to one bit of code would require a change to the other bit of the code  or if some change to another piece of code would require both bits of code to change for our program to still be correct.</description>

The data source is fairly small so loading the stream into memory wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem.
Carlos pointed me to a bit of Java code that did this and I converted it as literally as possible into Scala.</description>

      <description>We recently changed the way that we test against our main integration point on the project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on so that in our tests we retrieve the service object from our dependency injection container instead of &amp;lsquo;newing&amp;rsquo; one up.
Our tests therefore went from looking like this:
[Test] public void ShouldTestSomeService() { var someService = new SomeService(); // and so on }  To something more like this:
[Test] public void ShouldTestSomeService() { var someService = UnityFactory.</description>

The object that I wanted to construct was a read only object so it seemed to make sense to make it a value object. The object would be immutable and once created none of the attributes of the object would change.
This was my first attempt at writing the code for this object:</description>

Naresh describes the &amp;lsquo;primitive obsession&amp;rsquo; anti pattern as being the crux of poor design:
 I would argue that I’ve seen code which does not have much duplication but its very difficult to understand what’s going on. Hence I claim, “only if the code had better abstractions it would be a lot easier to understand and evolve the code”.</description>

I think the impact new people provide is particularly useful on a challenging project where they may be able to have a much more immediate impact.</description>

      <description>In our latest technical book club we discussed chapters 3,4 and 5 of Michael Feathers&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;rsquo; - &amp;lsquo;Sensing and Separation&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;The Seam Model&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Tools&amp;rsquo;.
These are some of my thoughts from our discussion of these chapters:
 Feathers suggests two reasons why we break dependencies when trying to get tests in place - sensing and separation. The former involves the breaking of dependencies in order to get access to the values computed in our code and the latter is necessary so that we can get our code into a test harness to start with.</description>

We had a requirement to show some content on every page of the website we&amp;rsquo;re working on. The content would be slightly different depending on which business process you&amp;rsquo;re doing.
Our first solution made use of an already defined &amp;lsquo;BusinessType&amp;rsquo; property which allowed us to work out which content we needed to create.</description>

We typically have code which looks like this:
public class SomeController { public ActionResult SomeControllerAction() { var someModel = new SomeModel { Property1 = &amp;quot;my Property&amp;quot; }; return new JsonResult { Data = someModel }; } } public class SomeModel { public string Property1 { get; set; } }  We would make use of this type of object in javascript code like so:</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go back to reading a book in our technical book club after a few months of discussing different papers and the chosen book is Michael Feathers&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&amp;rsquo;.
We started off by reading the first two chapters titled &amp;lsquo;Changing Software&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Working with Feedback&amp;rsquo; and these are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the chapters:
 Early on Feathers talks about the need to change software in order to add features and fix bugs and while it is certainly necessary to make some changes to code in order to do this we discussed whether there is ever a time that we might look to keep the number of changes we&#39;re making to a minimum.</description>

      <description>In my continued attempts to learn a bit of Scala I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out the 2nd of Dave Thomas&amp;rsquo; code katas - Karate Chop - while using an array slicing approach.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried out the iterative approach to this problem in Java about a year ago and it ends up being quite verbose so I thought the array slicing one would be much more concise.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t drive any of the solutions I worked on from the tests - in fact I only got all the tests provided by Dave Thomas running right at the end which was probably a mistake in retrospect.</description>

      <description>I recently came across an interesting post by Dave Thomas where he discussed several domain specific languages (DSLs) he&amp;rsquo;s come across and suggests that a lot of them seem to be trying too hard to read like the english language instead of focusing on describing a vocabulary for their specific domain
Reading this post reminded me that I fell into this trap earlier in the year while doing some work to create a builder pattern in our code which didn&amp;rsquo;t need to make use of a &amp;lsquo;Build&amp;rsquo; method but instead would make use of C#&amp;rsquo;s implicit operator to automatically convert the builder to an object at the appropriate moment.</description>

      <description>A colleague and I were working on some code a couple of weeks ago which mostly revolved around investigating the C# reflection API to work out which methods we needed to use.
My colleague was driving while we were doing this and our progress seemed very much based on intuition about the API rather than being gradual.
In fact it was quite similar to one of the situations in which Uncle Bob suggests TDD doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so well:</description>

      <title>TDD: Keeping assertions clear</title>

      <description>Something which I noticed was a problem with the first example test that I provided in my post about API readability and testability is that the assertion we are making is not that great.
[Test] public void ShouldConstructModelForSomeSituation() { Assert.AreEqual(DateTime.Today.ToDisplayFormat(), model.SomeDate()); }  It&amp;rsquo;s not really obvious what the expected result is supposed to be except that it should be the &amp;lsquo;DisplayFormat&amp;rsquo;. If that fails then we&amp;rsquo;ll need to navigate to the &amp;lsquo;ToDisplayFormat&amp;rsquo; method to work out what that method does.</description>

      <description>About a month ago or so I described how we did some work to ensure that we were calling a class the same way in our tests as in our production code and while I think that was a good choice in that situation we came across a similar problem this week where we weren&amp;rsquo;t so sure.
The piece of code in question was being used to create the view model for a page and one of the pieces of data that we wanted to show on this page was the date on which something would be valid which is currently today&amp;rsquo;s date.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a interview with Dave Hoover where he talks through the idea of working as an apprentice software developer and suggests some ways to do this more effectively.
I think the easiest thing to get wrong in software development is to over estimate our ability and there is even a study that proves that theory. Hoover refers to this as &amp;lsquo;having an accurate self assessment&amp;rsquo;.
If we work on the same project for a while then we&amp;rsquo;re going to get pretty good at navigating that code base and we&amp;rsquo;ll probably be able to solve any problem and add any piece of functionality fairly easily which only helps fuel the belief.</description>

These are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the video:
 While talking about how to write interaction tests he suggests that we should only be looking to create interfaces for Domain Driven Design services. If we find ourselves wanting to create interfaces for entities or value objects then we probably have a service wanting to get out.</description>

Functional programming I started playing around with F# about 11 months ago after becoming intrigued about this approach to programming following some conversations with my colleague Phil Calcado.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a post by Ayende where he talks about the need for tests to justify themselves and describes his approach to testing which doesn&amp;rsquo;t involved TDDing all the code he writes.
While this approach clearly works well for Ayende I really like the following comment by Alex Simkin:
 Anyway, this post should be marked MA (Mature Audience Only), so younger programmers wont use excuse to not write unit tests because Ayende doesn&#39;t do it.</description>

      <description>I came across an interesting post about a month or so written by Chad Fowler on Tim Ferriss&amp;rsquo; blog where he suggested that a useful way of ensuring that we are always improving is to ask the question &amp;lsquo;Am I better than yesterday?&amp;rsquo; at the end of each day.
I really like this idea and I think it fits in quite nicely with the approach that I take which is to try and ensure that I learn one new thing each day.</description>

      <description>My colleague Liz Douglass and I have been playing around with Scala and Liz recently pointed out Phil Gold&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Ninety Nine Scala Problems&amp;rsquo; which we&amp;rsquo;ve been working through.
One in particular which is quite interesting is number 7 where we need to flatten a nested list structure.
Therefore given this input:
flatten(List(List(1, 1), 2, List(3, List(5, 8))))  We would expect this output:
res0: List[Any] = List(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)  I tried this out on my own using recursion but kept ending up creating a stack overflow by writing code that never terminated!</description>

In this presentation he presents quite a number of different ideas that he has learned from his experiences in software development over the years.
These are some of my thoughts and our discussion:
 The first part of the presentation talks about method size and Feathers observes that there seems to be a power law with relation to the size of methods in code bases - i.</description>

      <description>Something which has become quite apparent to me recently is that I learn things far more quickly if I try it out myself and make mistakes than if I just rely on someone else&amp;rsquo;s word for it but some more experienced colleagues seem able to use information explained to them fair more effectively and don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need to go through this process.
While reading through the Dreyfus Model one of the ideas that is suggested is that once people reach the level of &amp;lsquo;Proficient&amp;rsquo; at any given skill then they are able to learn from the experiences of others without needing to experience something themselves.</description>

Unit testing When I first read Joel&amp;rsquo;s post I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like it because it seems to downplay the role of unit testing when coding, something which I believe is quite important from my experience of software development so far.</description>

      <description>My colleague Matt Dunn and I have been putting a lot of tests around some code over the last few days so that we can safely make some changes around that area and having finally created our safety net we&amp;rsquo;ve moved onto adding in the new functionality.
We&amp;rsquo;re test driving the new bit of functionality whereas with the previous code only the code had been written with no unit tests and it&amp;rsquo;s been quite interesting seeing the contrast in the style of code which seems to come out from these differing styles.</description>

 Three rules for database work The baseline Change scripts Views, Stored Procedures and the like Branching and Merging  These are some of my thoughts and our discussion:
 We had an interesting discussion around when it&#39;s ok to go and change checked in change scripts - on previous projects I&#39;ve worked on we&#39;ve actually had the rule that once you&#39;ve checked in a change script to source control then you can no longer change it but instead need to add another change script that does what you want.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been re-reading a post my colleague Ian Cartwright wrote earlier this year about treating test code the same way as production code and one thing which stands out as something which I&amp;rsquo;m certainly guilty off is copying and pasting tests.
Ian lists the following problems with doing this:
 The first one is cut &amp; paste, for some reason when it comes to unit tests people suddenly start cutting and pasting all over the place.</description>

      <description>During J.B. Rainsberger&amp;rsquo;s presentation at Agile 2009 titled &amp;lsquo;Integration tests are a scam&amp;rsquo; he suggests that having lots of integrationt tests covering our code can give us a false sense of confidence that we are testing our code and I think the same can happen with unit tests as well if we&amp;rsquo;re not careful how we write them.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to ensure that our unit tests are actually testing something useful otherwise the cost of writing and maintaining them will outweigh the benefits that we derive from doing so.</description>

      <description>While the test data builder pattern is quite a useful one for simplifying the creation of test data in our tests I think we need to be quite careful when using it that we don&amp;rsquo;t lose the intent of the test that we&amp;rsquo;re writing.
The main advantage that I see with this pattern is that by using it we can provide default values for properties of our objects which aren&amp;rsquo;t important for the bit of functionality that we&amp;rsquo;re currently testing but which need to be provided otherwise the test can&amp;rsquo;t actually be run.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite ideas that I came across while reading the Poppendieck&amp;rsquo;s Lean Software Development is set based concurrent engineering which encourages us to keep our options open with regards to the solution to a problem until we absolutely need to decide on an approach after which we probably can&amp;rsquo;t easily change that decision so we will most likely stick with it.
I like the idea but on the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on we often seem to take a more point based approach - there will be some discussion up front on the potential solutions to a problem and eventually one of them will be considered to be the best solution and we go and implement that one.</description>

      <description>In a post I wrote earlier in the week I described a dilemma we were having testing some code which made use of abstract classes and Perryn Fowler, Liz Keogh and Pat Maddox pointed out that a useful approach for this problem would be to make use of an abstract test class.
The idea here is that we create an equivalent hierarchy to our production code for our tests which in the example that I provided would mean that we have roughly the following setup:</description>

The code I&amp;rsquo;d refactored originally looked like this:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with Scala a bit and in particular following some of the code examples from Daniel Spiewak&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Scala for Java Refugees&amp;rsquo; article on Traits and Types.
One thing that I got a bit confused about in one of the examples was the use of the &amp;lsquo;_&amp;rsquo; at the end of one of the function definitions:
class MyContainer[T] { private var obj:T = null def value = obj def value_=(v:T) = obj = v } val cont = new MyContainer[String] cont.</description>

      <description>We ran into another interesting testing dilemma while refactoring the view model code which I described in an earlier post to the point where we have an abstract class and three sub classes which means that we now have 3 classes which did the same thing 80% of the time.
As I mentioned in a post a couple of weeks ago one of the main refactorings that we did was to move some calls to dependency methods from the constructor and into properties so that those calls would only be made if necessary.</description>

      <description>I previously described a refactoring that we have been working on to reduce the number of fields and delay calculations and the actual goal behind this refactoring was to get the code into shape so that we could add in the logic for a new business process that our application needed to handle.

      <title>TDD: Test only constructors</title>

      <description>I wrote previously how we&amp;rsquo;d been doing some work to change the way that we get a &amp;lsquo;User&amp;rsquo; object into our system and one mistake that we made intially was to have another constructor on the &amp;lsquo;User&amp;rsquo; object which was being used in all our unit tests which involved the user in some way.
The original reason that this &amp;lsquo;test constructor&amp;rsquo; was created was to make it easier to construct a &amp;lsquo;fake user&amp;rsquo; which we were using in some of our functional tests but had ended up being used in unit tests as well.</description>

      <title>Impersonators: Using them in showcases</title>

      <description>Towards the end of my colleague Julio Maia&amp;rsquo;s blog post about the impersonator pattern he suggests that the standalone environment that we can create through the use of impersonators can be quite useful for showcases and we actually had a recent occasion where we had to switch mid-showcase from using the integration environment to make use of an impersonator.
In this case part of the environment went down in the middle of the showcase so if we wanted to keep on going then that was our only option but in general the expectation of the business is that our showcases show them the functionality of the application end to end.</description>

      <description>Recently my pair and I were trying to merge some changes into our code that we had just picked up fron updating from the trunk and realised that we weren&amp;rsquo;t actually sure how to resolve that merge since it seemed to conflict with what we&amp;rsquo;d been working on.
We hadn&amp;rsquo;t checked in for longer than we would have liked to due to a bit of a checkin pile up which had happened because the build on the CI server had been failing for a few hours due to a temporary problem we were having with an external dependency.</description>

      <description>I mentioned previously that we&amp;rsquo;re making use of Fiddler quite a lot on my current project, mainly to check the traffic going to and from the service layer, and I&amp;rsquo;m quite curious how it actually works.
In particular I wanted to know:
 How we&#39;re able to route requests through Fiddler and then through the corporate proxy How proxy settings work differently for Firefox and Internet Explorer  As far as I&amp;rsquo;m aware the source code for Fiddler isn&amp;rsquo;t available so a colleague and I tracked the various proxy settings when Fiddler was turned on and off and also had a look at some registry settings.</description>

      <description>Something which we discussed quite frequently when studying Domain Driven Design in our technical book club earlier this year was where the code which checked whether we had setup an object correctly should reside.
Shortly after that I suggested that I didn&amp;rsquo;t think it should go in the constructor of an object but that we should rely on objects to be good citizens and not pass in null values or the like to other objects.</description>

      <description>In this weeks book club we discussed Arlo Belshee&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;lsquo;Promiscuous Pairing and Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Mind&amp;rsquo; where he presents the idea of rotating pairs more frequently than we might usually, suggesting that the optimal rotation time is 90 minutes.
I remember coming across the idea of promiscuous pairing a couple of years ago but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t read the paper all the way through and so far haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on a team where we&amp;rsquo;ve really tried out his ideas.</description>

      <description>In our latest coding dojo we played around with Scala and lambdaj while attempting to solve some of the problems on the Project Euler website.
The Format We started off on two different machines with two of us having a look at solving the first Project Euler problem in Scala and the other two trying to solve it in Java while using the lambdaj library.
What did we learn?  Fabio and I worked on the Scala solution to the problem and we were pretty much playing around with different ways to aggregate all the values in the list: ~~~scala 1.</description>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2009/09/02/coding-reduce-fields-delay-calculations/</guid>
      <description>A pattern in code which I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed quite frequently lately is that of executing calculations in the constructor of an object and then storing the result in a field on the object.
From the small amount of experience I have playing around with functional languages I have come across the idea of lazy evaluation of functions quite frequently and I think it&amp;rsquo;s something that we can apply in object oriented languages as well.</description>

      <description>I previously wrote about some duplicated code we&amp;rsquo;d taken the time to remove from our code base and one something else that we found when working with this code is that a lot of the tests around this code were testing the implementation/internal state of the object rather than testing the behaviour that they expected to see.
I find it makes more sense to test the behaviour since this is the way that the object will most likely be used in our production code.</description>

      <description>While discussing the duplication in our code based which I described in an earlier post with some other colleagues earlier this week I realised that I had actually gone past this code a couple of times previously, seen that there was a problem with it but hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken any steps to fix it other than to make a mental note that I would fix it when I got the chance.</description>

      <description>One of the most common activities for software developers is removing duplication from code and Dave recently showed me a technique which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before for doing this more effectively - first group all the code into one place without removing any of the duplication and then remove the duplication when everything is in one place.
The code where we tried out this technique was being used to construct the model for the navigation at the top of the pages on the website we&amp;rsquo;re working on and before we grouped the duplication the code looked a bit like this:</description>

He also did a version of this talk in the February European Alt.NET meeting.
In this presentation Greg talks about Command Query Separation at the architecture level and explicit state transitions amongst other things.
Jonathan Oliver has created a useful resource page of the material that&amp;rsquo;s been written about some of these ideas as well.</description>

      <description>We spent a bit of time yesterday looking through the jQuery code trying to work out why a cross domain request we were making using jQuery&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;$.post&amp;rsquo; function wasn&amp;rsquo;t working.
In hindsight perhaps it should have been obvious that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to do that but I didn&amp;rsquo;t completely understand how we were able to do cross domain requests were possible at all but we had some &amp;lsquo;$.getJson&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;jsonp&amp;rsquo; function calls around our code base which were doing just that.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been pairing a bit more regularly recently after more sporadic pairing sessions over the last 9 or 10 months and I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up some habits which aren&amp;rsquo;t really that effective when pairing so I&amp;rsquo;m on a mission to sort that out.
Moving around the code too quickly One thing that I often forget is that when you&amp;rsquo;re driving you know exactly where you&amp;rsquo;re going with the mouse or keyboard just before you do it whereas the other person doesn&amp;rsquo;t know until you&amp;rsquo;ve done it.</description>

      <description>We came across an interesting situation in our code base recently whereby two coding approaches which I consider important for writing maintainable code seemed to come into conflict with each other.
The code we were working on needed to retrieve some customer details from a backend system by making use of the current user&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;customerId&amp;rsquo; which we can retrieve from the &amp;lsquo;LoggedInUser&amp;rsquo;.
My initial thought was that since we only needed one property of the &amp;lsquo;LoggedInUser&amp;rsquo; we could just pass in the &amp;lsquo;customerId&amp;rsquo; instead of the &amp;lsquo;LoggedInUser&amp;rsquo;:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written a few times previously about pair programming and how I think it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best practices I&amp;rsquo;ve seen used on agile teams but in order to ensure that we&amp;rsquo;re making the best use of this practice it&amp;rsquo;s important to ensure that both people are engaged.
It is often quite difficult to persuade people who aren&amp;rsquo;t used to extreme programming that having two people working at the same machine is actually beneficial and this task can be made even more difficult if one person is losing focus or interest and therefore isn&amp;rsquo;t actually adding much value in that pairing session.</description>

      <description>One of the quite common sayings that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across when discussing student/teacher type situations is that it&amp;rsquo;s the teacher&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to present the material to the student in a way that they can understand and that if the student still doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand then the teacher hasn&amp;rsquo;t done their job properly.
I believe that this approach is also followed in the UK education system nowadays and while it makes sense in a way I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a particularly useful belief to have as a student since it seems to encourage you to be quite passive in the learning process.</description>

      <description>An interesting problem that we have come across a few times over the past 6 months is the dilemma about what to do when start work on a feature and get part way through it before it gets descoped from the current iteration, maybe to be picked up later on but maybe not.
The easiest, and there most common, approach is to just leave the code in the code base half complete and then hopefully return to it at some later stage.</description>

      <description>Something I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a bit lately is tests which setup a load of dependencies for a test and then do assertions on that setup before getting on to calling the system under test.
The code tends to be similar to this:
public void ShouldHopefullyDoSomeAwesomeStuff() { // setup via expectations for dependency1 and dependency2 Assert.IsNotNull(dependency1.DependedOnMethod);	new SystemUnderTest(dependency1, dependency2).DoThatStuff(); // test assertions }  I&amp;rsquo;ve done this a fair few times myself and I used to believe that it actually made the test more valuable since we were ensuring that the dependencies were in a good state before we executed the test.</description>

Ideally we want to put the impersonator in a place where we can easily turn it on or off depending on whether we want to use the impersonator or the real end point.</description>

      <description>Phil Haack wrote a post a few weeks ago about the law of demeter and how it&amp;rsquo;s not just about reducing the number of dots that appear on one line.
This is a nice side effect of following the law of demeter but I often feel that the main benefit we get from following it is that code becomes easier to change since we haven&amp;rsquo;t exposed the state of an object all over the place.</description>

      <description>I wrote previously about an impersonator we are using on my project which Martin Fowler has dubbed the &amp;lsquo;self initializing fake&amp;rsquo; and although I thought this was the only type of situation where we might use this approach, from discussing this with my colleague Julio Maia and from experiences on the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on I realise there are other advantages to this approach as well.
To deal with unstable/slow integration points This is the main reason that we use the self initializing fake and provides perhaps the most obvious reason why we might create an impersonator because we will remain in pain if we don&#39;t create one.</description>

      <description>I wrote a couple of months ago about an approach we&amp;rsquo;re using to help people find test data builders in our code base by hanging those builders off a class called &amp;lsquo;GetBuilderFor&amp;rsquo; and I think it&amp;rsquo;s worked reasonably well.
However, a couple of weeks ago my colleague Lu Ning suggested another way to achieve our goal of allowing people to find the builders easily.
The approach he suggested is to put all of the builders in the same namespace, for example &amp;lsquo;Builders&amp;rsquo;, so that if someone wants to find out if a builder already exists they can just type &amp;lsquo;Builders.</description>

      <description>One of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed over the past few years of working on software delivery projects is that the most challenging projects, the ones that most people hate working on, tend to last the longest yet teach you the most although maybe not immediately.
The problem is that a lot of the time we are in a state of frustration with all the things that are wrong about the project and therefore don&amp;rsquo;t focus on the things that we can do to make our situation better and improve the chances of the project to deliver.</description>

      <description>The Book Zen Mind, Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Mind by Shunryu Suzuki
The Review I first came across the actual term beginner&amp;rsquo;s mind when reading through the &amp;lsquo;Wear The White Belt&amp;rsquo; chapter of Apprenticeship Patterns although it was often mentioned to me on one of the first projects I did at ThoughtWorks a couple of years ago that people liked teaching me things because I just took the information in pretty much without questioning.</description>

      <description>Since we discussed the Dreyfus Model in book club a few weeks ago I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that I&amp;rsquo;m more aware of my own level of skill at different tasks and references to the model appear more frequent at least amongst my colleagues.
These are some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about:
How do we use the model? Alan Skorks has an interesting post where he discusses the role of the Dreyfus Model in helping to build software development expertise concluding that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help very much in developing expertise within a team.</description>

      <description>In this weeks dojo we decided to revisit the &amp;ldquo;TDD as if you meant it&amp;rsquo; exercise originally invented by Keith Braithwaite for the Software Craftsmanship Conference but recently tried out at the Alt.NET UK Conference in London.
The idea was to write code for &amp;lsquo;tic tac toe&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;naughts and crosses&amp;rsquo; and we were following these requirements:
a game is over when all fields are taken a game is over when all fields in a column are taken by a player a game is over when all fields in a row are taken by a player a game is over when all fields in a diagonal are taken by a player a player can take a field if not already taken players take turns taking fields until the game is over  The code from Alt.</description>

      <description>In last week&amp;rsquo;s book club we discussed an article written by Jeremy Miller for MSDN Magazine titled &amp;lsquo;Object Role Stereotypes&amp;rsquo; which discusses part of Rebecca Wirfs Brock&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;lsquo;Object Design&amp;rsquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to read Object Design for about a year since coming across the book while reading through the slides from JAOO Sydney 2008 but I&amp;rsquo;ve often found the reading to be quite abstract and have struggled to work out how to apply the ideas to the coding I do day to day.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a blog post by Seth Godin where he coins the term &amp;lsquo;bear shaving&amp;rsquo; which is where we address the symptoms of a problem instead of addressing the problem.
The main example he gives is the idea of shaving a bear so that it can deal with the increased temperature caused by global warming instead of addressing the underlying problem which has led to this happening in the first place.</description>

Right now I find myself in favour of Jeremy&amp;rsquo;s approach which is more about writing some code and then getting some feedback on it and then writing some more code instead of spending a lot of time thinking before we write any code.</description>

      <description>I find one of the most applicable mantras in software development is Bob Sutton&amp;rsquo;s idea that we should have strong opinions weakly held.
The idea as I understand it is that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t sit on the fence but instead have an opinion that we research thoroughly and are prepared to back up. However, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t become too attached to those opinions but instead be prepared to listen to alternative points of view and take those on where they prove more useful than our previous opinions.</description>

      <description>In our latest book club we discussed Alistair Cockburn&amp;rsquo;s Hexagonal Architecture which I first heard about around a year ago and was another of Dave Cameron&amp;rsquo;s recommendations.
As I understand it, the article describes an architecture for our systems where the domain sits in the centre and other parts of the system depend on the domain while the domain doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on anything concrete but is interacted with by various adapters.</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time recently reading through some of the Rhino Mocks to get a basic understanding of how some features work under the hood.
As well as just getting some practice at reading unfamiliar code I also wanted to know the following:
 How does the &#39;VerifyAllExpectations&#39; extension method work? What&#39;s the difference between the &#39;GenerateMock&#39; and &#39;GenerateStub&#39; methods on MockRepository? How does the &#39;AssertWasNotCalled&#39; extension method actually work?</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time over the weekend playing around with F# asynchronous workflows and seeing how they could be used to launch Firefox windows asynchronously for my FeedBurner graph creator.
Initially I decided to try out the &amp;lsquo;Async.RunWithContinuations&amp;rsquo; function which I recently read about on Matthew Podwysocki&amp;rsquo;s blog.
Matthew describes this as being a function which is useful for executing a single operation asynchronously and this worked out quite well for me as my application only has the ability to get one feed and then create a graph from its data.</description>

      <description>One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed recently in my playing around with F# is that when we decide to wrap calls to the .NET DateTime methods there is a need to be quite careful that we are wrapping those calls with an F# function and not an F# value.
If we don&amp;rsquo;t do this then the DateTime method will only be evaluated once and then return the same value for every call which is probably not the behaviour we&amp;rsquo;re looking for.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned previously we&amp;rsquo;re making use of multiple cruise agents in our build to allow us to run our acceptance tests in parallel, therefore allowing a build which would be nearly 2 hours if run in sequence to be completed in around 10 minutes.
Early on with this approach we were getting a lot of failures in our builds which weren&amp;rsquo;t directly related to the code being changed and were more to do with the various dependencies we were making use of.</description>

      <title>Wrapping collections: Inheritance vs Composition</title>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2009/07/24/wrapping-collections-inheritance-vs-composition/</guid>
      <description>I wrote previously about the differences between wrapping collections and just creating extension methods to make our use of collections in the code base more descriptive but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed in code I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading recently that there appear to be two ways of wrapping the collection - using composition as I described previously but also extending the collection by using inheritance.
I was discussing this with Lu Ning recently and he pointed out that if what we have is actually a collection then it might make more sense to extend the collection with a custom class whereas if the collection is just an implementation detail of some other domain concept then it would be better to use composition.</description>

      <description>One of the things I remember picking up from reading The Pragmatic Programmer is that developers need to be lazy in order to find better ways to solve problems and I came across a post by Philipp Lensson from a few years ago where he also suggests good developers are lazy and dumb.
Something which I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realise more recently is that it&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily true that being lazy as a developer is always a good thing - it depends in what way you are being lazy because there are certainly good and bad ways in which you can express your laziness!</description>

      <description>One of the most important things to achieve if we are to get any sort of productivity when writing code is to find ways to get the quickest feedback possible.
My general default stance with respect to this has always been to TDD code although I&amp;rsquo;ve found when coding in F# that I&amp;rsquo;m not actually sure what the overall best way to get quick feedback is.
This is partly because I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to find a way to run tests easily from inside Visual Studio but also partly because even when you do this the code for the whole project needs to be recompiled before the tests can be run which takes time.</description>

      <description>I decided to spend some time doing some refactoring on the FeedBurner application that I started working on last week and the first area I worked on was cleaning up the way that the xml we get from FeedBurner is parsed.
While playing around with the application from the command line I realised that it didn&amp;rsquo;t actually cover error conditions - such as passing in an invalid feed name - very well and I thought this would be a good opportunity to make use of an active pattern to handle this.</description>

      <description>In our latest book club we discussed the Dreyfus Model, a paper written in 1980 by Stuart and Hubert Dreyfus.
I&amp;rsquo;ve become quite intrigued by the Dreyfus Model particularly since reading about its applicability to software development in Andy Hunt&amp;rsquo;s Pragmatic Learning and Thinking and after looking through Pat Kua&amp;rsquo;s presentation on &amp;lsquo;Climbing the Dreyfus Ladder of Agile Practices&amp;rsquo; I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be interesting to study the original paper.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a bit of refactoring of my FeedBurner application so that I can call it from the command line with the appropriate arguments and one of the problems I came across is working out how to pass arguments from the command line into an F# script.
With a compiled application we are able to make use of the &amp;lsquo;EntryPointAttribute&amp;rsquo; to get access to the arguments passed in:
[&amp;lt;EntryPointAttribute&amp;gt;] let main args = ShowFeedBurnerStats args 0  Sadly this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with a script but it was pointed out on Hub FS that we can get access to all the command line arguments by using &amp;lsquo;Sys.</description>

      <description>Our latest book club session was a discussion on a paper written by my colleague Chris Stevenson and Andy Pols titled &amp;lsquo;An Agile Approach to a Legacy System&amp;rsquo; which I think was written in 2004. This paper was suggested by Dave Cameron.
These are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the paper:
 The first thing that was quite interesting was that the authors pointed out that if you just try and rewrite a part of a legacy system you are actually just writing legacy code yourself - we weren&#39;t sure exactly what was meant by this since for me at least the definition of legacy code is &#39;code which we are scared to change [because it has no tests]&#39; but presumably the new code did have tests so it wasn&#39;t legacy in this sense.</description>

      <description>My colleague Sarah Taraporewalla recently wrote about her thoughts on test doubles (to use Gerard Meszaros&amp;rsquo; language) and it got me thinking about the approach I generally take in this area.
Stub objects I use stubs mostly to control the output of depended on components of the system under test where we don&amp;rsquo;t want to verify those outputs.
Most of the time I make use of the mocking library&amp;rsquo;s ability to stub out method calls on these dependencies.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a bit of the day writing a little application to take the xml from my Feedburner RSS feed and create a graph showing the daily &amp;amp; weekly average subscribers.
What did I learn?  I decided that I wanted to parameterise the feedburner url so that I would be able to run the code for different time periods and against different feeds. In C# we&amp;rsquo;d probably make use of &amp;lsquo;string.</description>

One thing which I found while doing this is that calls to the .NET base class library don&amp;rsquo;t seem to fit in that well with the way that you would typically compose functions together in F#.</description>

      <description>We ran a session on Continuous Integration at the most recent Community College in the ThoughtWorks Sydney office.
It was roughly based around a CI Maturity Model which I recently came across although the intention was to find out what other teams were doing CI wise.
I became a bit more aware of how little I know about CI after listening to a Software Engineering Radio interview with my colleague Chris Read so I was keen to see how other teams are approaching this problem.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been continuing working on a little script to parse Cruise build data and the latest task was to work out how to download my Google Graph API created image onto the local disk.
I&amp;rsquo;m using the WebClient class to do this and the code looks like this:
let DownloadGraph (fileLocation:string) (uri:System.Uri) = async { let webClient = new WebClient() webClient.DownloadFileAsync(uri, fileLocation)}  Sadly this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work when I run it from the client site where I have access to the build metrics as there is a corporate proxy sitting in the way.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been continuing playing around with parsing Cruise data as I mentioned yesterday with the goal today being to create a graph from the build data.
After recommendations from Dean Cornish and Sam Newman on Twitter I decided to give the Google Graph API a try to do this and realised that I would need to create a comma separated string listing all the build times to pass to the Google API.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around a bit with the properties REST API that Cruise exposes to try and get together some build metrics and I decided it might be an interesting task to try and use F# for.
I&amp;rsquo;m making use of the &amp;lsquo;search&amp;rsquo; part of the API to return the metrics of all the builds run on a certain part of the pipeline and I then want to parse those results so that I can extract just the name of the agent that ran that build and the duration of that build.</description>

      <description>Our latest technical book club discussion was based around Philip Wadler&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;lsquo;Why noone uses functional langauges&amp;rsquo; which he wrote in 1998. I came across this paper when reading some of the F# goals in the FAQs on the Microsoft website.
These are some of my thoughts and our discussion of the paper:
 One of the points suggested in the paper is that functional languages aren&#39;t used because of their lack of availability on machines but as Dave pointed out this doesn&#39;t really seem to be such a big problem these days - certainly for F# I&#39;ve found it relatively painless to get it setup and running and even for a language like Ruby people are happy to download and install it on their machines and it is also pretty much painless to do so.</description>

      <description>One of the problems that we&amp;rsquo;ve come across while writing the mapping code for our anti corruption layer is that there is quite a lot of duplication of mapping similar types due to the fact that each service has different auto generated classes representing the same data structure.
We are making SOAP web service calls and generating classes to represent the requests and responses to those end points using SvcUtil. We then translate from those auto generated classes to our domain model using various mapper classes.</description>

      <description>I previously wrote about some of the Domain Driven Design patterns we have noticed on my project and I think the pattern which ties all these together is the anti corruption layer.
The reason why you might use an anti corruption layer is to create a little padding between subsystems so that they do not leak into each other too much.
 Remember, an ANTICORRUPTION LAYER is a means of linking two BOUNDED CONTEXTS.</description>

      <description>The Book Brownfield Application Development in .NET by Kyle Baley and Donald Belcham
The Review I asked to be sent this book to review by Manning as I was quite intrigued to see how well it would complement Michael Feather&amp;rsquo;s Working Effectively with Legacy Code, the other book I&amp;rsquo;m aware of which covers approaches to dealing with non green field applications.
What did I learn?  The authors provide a brief description of the two different approaches to unit testing - state based and behaviour based - I&#39;m currently in favour of the latter approach and Martin Fowler has a well known article which covers pretty much anything you&#39;d want to know about this topic area.</description>

      <description>Something which constantly surprises me about Domain Driven Design is how there is a pattern described in the book for just about every possible situation you find yourself in when coding on projects.
A lot of these patterns appear in the &amp;lsquo;Strategic Design&amp;rsquo; section of the book and one which is very relevant for the project I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on is the &amp;lsquo;Conformist&amp;rsquo; pattern which is described like so:
 When two development teams have an upstream/downstream relationship in which the upstream has no motivation to provide for the downstream team&#39;s needs, the downstream team is helpless.</description>

      <description>Our latest coding dojo involved working on a variation of the traveling salesman problem in Groovy again.
The Format We had 8 people participating this week so we returned to the Randori format, rotating the pair at the keyboard every 7 minutes.
Give the number of people it might have actually been better to have a couple of machines and use the UberDojo format.
What We Learnt  The importance of just getting started stood out a lot for me in this dojo - there have been quite a few times when we&#39;ve met intending to do some coding and spent so long talking about coding that we didn&#39;t end up writing anything.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a bit more reading of the Fake source code and one interesting thing which I came across which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen was an active pattern which was making use of the &amp;lsquo;:?&amp;rsquo; operator to match the input type against .NET types.
let (|File|Directory|) (fileSysInfo : FileSystemInfo) = match fileSysInfo with | :? FileInfo as file -&amp;gt; File (file.Name) | :? DirectoryInfo as dir -&amp;gt; Directory (dir.Name, seq { for x in dir.</description>

I recently listened to an interview with Michael Nygard on Software Engineering Radio so I was interested in reading more of his stuff and Cam suggested that the logging chapter would be an interesting one to look at as it&amp;rsquo;s often something which we don&amp;rsquo;t spend a lot of time thinking about on software development teams.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve included the slides below but there was also some interesting discussion as well.
 One of the questions asked was around how you would deal with code on a real project with regards to structuring it and ensuring that it was maintainable.</description>

      <description>One of the most frustrating things for me lately about interacting with C# libraries from F# has been setting up objects through the use of properties.
While I am against the use of setters to construct objects in the first place, that&amp;rsquo;s the way that a lot of libraries work so it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a necessary evil!
In C# we would typically make use of the object initializer syntax to do this, but in F# I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing code like this to do the same thing:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a bit of time reading through the Fake source code to try and understand how it works and one of the things which I quite like about it is the way the authors have made use of different F# operators to make expressions easier to read by reducing the number of brackets that need to be written and reordering the functions/values depending on the particular context.
One which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before is the application operator which is the opposite of the forward operator which I have previously written about.</description>

The code we wrote is available on bitbucket.
The Format Cam, Dean and I took turns pairing with each other with the code projected onto a TV. As there were only a few of us the discussion on where we were taking the code tended to included everyone rather than just the two at the keyboard.</description>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2009/06/26/safe-refactoring-removing-object-initializer-introducing-builder/</guid>
      <description>I previously wrote about an approach we took to safely remove some duplication and I recently followed a similar mantra to replace an object initializer call which had around 40 properties being setup with a builder to try and make the code a bit easier to understand.
We did have tests checking the values being setup by the object initializer so I was already able to refactor with some degree of safety - it would probably have been possible to just create the builder and build the object from that and then delete the old code and replace it with the new but I&amp;rsquo;ve caused myself too many problems from doing that before that I decided to try a more incremental approach.</description>

There seems to be quite a few books out at the moment about how to introduce a more agile approach into your organisation - I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Lean-Agile Software Development and Becoming Agile and there is also a book called Scaling Lean and Agile Development - so I was intrigued to see whether the messages from this talk would be similar to those in these books.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been using Fiddler to debug the requests and responses sent via web services to a service layer our application interacts with and it works pretty well when you run the application using Cassini but by default won&amp;rsquo;t work when you run the website through IIS.
The key to this as one of my colleagues (who gives credit to Erik) showed me today is to ensure that IIS is running under the same user that Fiddler is running under which in our case is the &amp;lsquo;Administrator&amp;rsquo; account.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve recently run into some places in our tests where the expectation and actual values passed into NUnit&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Assert.AreEqual&amp;rsquo; are the wrong way round, therefore meaning that the error messages we get when tests fail are somewhat confusing!
Assert.AreEqual(theActualValue, &amp;quot;the expectation&amp;quot;);  We can change the arguments around using Resharper by using the key combination &amp;lsquo;Ctrl-Alt-Shift-ArrowKey&amp;rsquo; but you can only do this one line at a time which was a bit annoying as there were about 20 to change.</description>

As I understand it we can achieve a continuation passing style of programming by passing in the bit of code that we went executed next (i.</description>

To quote the book:
A seam is a place where you can alter behaviour in your program without editing in that place Seams in the book are generally discussed in terms of how we can get tests around legacy code which was written without easy testability in mind but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that the ideas behind seams seem to be more widely applicable than this.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading through some of the other chapters online and I thought this would be an interesting chapter to talk about as people seem to have different opinions on how DRY tests should be, how we build test data, how we name tests and so on.</description>

      <description>One of the changes that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed in my coding now compared to around 7 or 8 months ago is that whenever there&amp;rsquo;s some operations to be performed on a collection I am far more inclined to think of how to do those operations using a functional approach.
I&amp;rsquo;ve written previously about the ways I&amp;rsquo;ve been making use of functional collection parameters in my code but what I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really considered was that the way of thinking about the problem we want to solve is slightly different.</description>

We decided to try out the idea of reading papers/individual chapters from books as it allows us to vary the type of stuff we&amp;rsquo;re reading more frequently and is an approach which Obie seems to be having some success with.</description>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2009/06/16/functional-collection-parameters-handling-the-null-collection/</guid>
      <description>One of the interesting cases where I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed we tend to avoid functional collection parameters in our code base is when there&amp;rsquo;s the possibility of the collection being null.
The code is on the boundary of our application&amp;rsquo;s interaction with another service so it is actually a valid scenario that we could receive a null collection.
When using extension methods, although we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get a null pointer exception by calling one on a null collection, we would get a &amp;lsquo;source is null&amp;rsquo; exception when the expression is evaluated so we need to protect ourself against this.</description>

      <description>I was recently discussing F# with a couple of colleagues and one thing that came up is the slightly different ways that we might choose to interact with certain .NET framework classes compared to how we use those same classes in C# code.
One of those where I see potential for different use is the Dictionary class.
In C# code when we&amp;rsquo;re querying a dictionary to check that a value exists before we try to extract it we might typically do this:</description>

      <title>F#: Using C# extension methods</title>

      <description>An interesting thing I noticed about referencing C# libraries from F# is that you can&amp;rsquo;t access C# extension methods on generic open types in the same way that you would be able to if you were using the library from C# code.
I came across this problem when playing around with the Rhino Mocks framework in some F# code.
I wrote a simple test to see whether I could get an expectation to work correctly, without paying any regard for the fact that you can&amp;rsquo;t use all C# extension methods in the same way as you can from C# code!</description>

      <title>F#: Overlapping fields in record types</title>

      <description>A problem which has confused me for a while is how to create instances of record types whose fields overlap with another record defined further down in an F# file.
The most recently defined record seems to take precedence even if it has more fields than a record defined earlier and you don&amp;rsquo;t specify all of those fields in your record creation attempt.
For example, if I have the following two record types:</description>

      <title>Coding: Single Level of Abstraction Principle</title>

      <description>One of the other useful principles for writing readable code that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across in the last year or so is the Single Level of Abstraction Principle.
I first came across the idea of writing code at the same level of abstraction in Uncle Bob&amp;rsquo;s Clean Code although I only learnt about the actual term in Neal Ford&amp;rsquo;s The Productive Programmer.
As the name suggests the idea is that within a certain method we look to keep all the code at the same level of abstraction to help us read it more easily.</description>

      <description>After a couple of weeks of more experimental coding dojos this week we decided to get back to some pure coding with the session being focused around doing some refactoring of the continuous integration server Cruise Control .NET.
The overall intention of the refactoring we worked on is to try and introduce the concept of a &amp;lsquo;ChangeSet&amp;rsquo; into the code base to represent the revisions that come in from source control systems that CC.</description>

      <description>Something which I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a few times recently in code is method names which describe the negative aspect of something and for me at least these are very difficult to understand since I need to keep remembering that we are dealing with the negative and not the positive which I think is significantly easier to reason about.
A recent example of this which I came across was in some acceptance test code which among other things was asserting whether or not the policy number that had been created was in a valid format and returning the result of that assertion back to our Fitnesse fixture.</description>

      <description>We had the need to do a bit of scripting recently to change the names of the folders where we store our artifacts to signify which artifacts were created from our build&amp;rsquo;s production branch and which were generated from the main branch.
The problem we had was that we were ending up overwriting old artifacts from the main branch with the production branch&amp;rsquo;s artifacts so we wanted to fix this.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on several software development teams over the last few years - some that pair programmed all the time and some that didn&amp;rsquo;t - and one of the key things that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is that the level of collaboration on these teams was significantly higher when pair programming was being done on a regular basis.
The following are some of the observations I have noticed in teams which don&amp;rsquo;t pair program frequently.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a bit more work on my twitter application over the weekend - this time taking the tweets that I&amp;rsquo;ve stored in CouchDB and displaying them on a web page.
One of the problems I had is that the text of the tweets is just plain text so if there is a link in a tweet then when I display it on a web page it isn&amp;rsquo;t clickable since it isn&amp;rsquo;t enclosed by the &amp;lsquo;&amp;#60;a href&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;/a&amp;#62;&amp;rsquo; tag.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing some code to map between CouchDB documents and F# objects and something which I re-learned while doing this is the way that interfaces work in F#.
In F# when you have a class which implements an interface that class makes use of explicit interface implementation.
This means that in order to access any members of the interface that the class implements you need to specifically refer to the interface by upcasting the value using the &amp;lsquo;:&amp;gt;&amp;rsquo; operator.</description>

      <description>Ever since I&amp;rsquo;ve read Uncle Bob&amp;rsquo;s Clean Code book my approach to coding has been all about the &amp;lsquo;extract method&amp;rsquo; refactoring - I pretty much look to extract method as much as I can until I get to the point where extracting another method would result in me just describing the language semantics in the method name.
One of the approaches that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across with regards to doing this refactoring is that it&amp;rsquo;s only used when there is duplication of code and we want to reduce that duplication so that it&amp;rsquo;s all in one place and then call that method from two places.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve previously written about the builder pattern which I think is a very useful pattern for helping to setup data.
It allows us to setup custom data when we care about a specific piece of data in a test or just use default values if we&amp;rsquo;re not bothered about a piece of data but need it to be present for our test to execute successfully.
One problem that I noticed was that despite the fact we had builders for quite a number of the classes we were using in our tests, when new tests were being added test data was still being setup by directly using the classes instead of making use of the builders which had already done the hard work for you.</description>

      <description>Tuples are one of the data types that I learnt about at university but never actually got to use for anything until I started playing around with F# which has this type in the language.
A tuple describes an ordered group of values and in that sense is similar to a C# anonymous type except an anonymous type&amp;rsquo;s values are named whereas a tuple&amp;rsquo;s are not.
In F# we can create one by separating a sequence of values with a comma in a value assignment:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing all my spare time .NET development from within VMWare for about the last year or so and now and then it&amp;rsquo;s quite useful to be able to access the host machine either to get some files from there or to access a server that&amp;rsquo;s running on the host.
The former problem is solved by going to &amp;lsquo;Virtual Machines -&amp;gt; Shared Folders&amp;rsquo; and clicking on the + button on the bottom left of the menu to add a folder that you want to share.</description>

Database information could not be retrieved: missing  I thought I&amp;rsquo;d have a quick look with FireBug to see if I could work out what was going on and saw several requests being made to the following urls and resulting in 404s:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with CouchDB a bit today and in particular making use of SharpCouch, a library which acts as a wrapper around CouchDB calls. It is included in the CouchBrowse library which is recommended as a good starting point for interacting with CouchDB from C# code.
I decided to work out how the API worked with by writing an integration test to save a document to the database.</description>

      <description>Continuing with my attempts to test some of the code in my twitter application I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to work out how to test the Erlang style messaging which I set up to process tweets when I had captured them using the TweetSharp API.
The problem I had is that that processing is being done asynchronously so we can&amp;rsquo;t test it in our normal sequential way.
Chatting with Dave about this he suggested that what I really needed was a latch which could be triggered when the asynchronous behaviour had completed, thus informing the test that it could proceed.</description>

A problem I ran into when attempting to run my tests against &amp;lsquo;xunit.console.exe&amp;rsquo; is that xUnit.NET is linked to run against version 2.0 of the CLR and right now you can&amp;rsquo;t actually change the &amp;lsquo;targetframework&amp;rsquo; for a project compiled in Visual Studio 2010.</description>

I recently read a book called &amp;lsquo;The Five Dysfunctions of Teams&amp;rsquo; which describe some behaviours in teams which aren&amp;rsquo;t working in an effective way.</description>

      <description>One area of development where I have sometimes wondered about the value that we can get from pair programming is when we&amp;rsquo;re spending time doing some major refactoring of our code base.
The reason I felt that pairing on big refactoring tasks might be difficult compared to when working on a story together is that with a story there tends to be a more defined goal and the business have defined that goal whereas with a refactoring task that goal is often less clear and people have much wider ranging differing opinions about the approach that should be taken.</description>

      <description>One of the most important things that I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt from the coding dojo sessions that we&amp;rsquo;ve been running over the last six months is the importance of small step refactorings.
Granted we have been trying to take some of the practices to the extreme but the basic idea of trying to keep the tests green for as much time as well as keeping our code in a state where it still compiles (in a static language) is very useful no matter what code we&amp;rsquo;re working on.</description>

      <description>Although I pointed out some things that I disagreed with in Nick&amp;rsquo;s post about pair programming one thing that I really liked in that post was that he emphasised the importance of getting tests from red to green as quickly as possible.
 I remember the best programming sessions I’ve had was with Stacy Curl, now an ex-thoughtworker and whom I believe was also a chess player. He would always look to quickly make my tests pass, even if it was to just echo the output that my tests would sometimes expect.</description>

      <description>My colleague Nick Carroll recently blogged some ideas about what to do if your pair is hogging the keyboard, suggesting using a timer which keeps track of how long each person has had at the keyboard as a useful way of ensuring that both people in the pair stay more engaged.
While I can see the thinking behind this I think it is addressing the wrong problem.
From my experience we don&amp;rsquo;t always want to be moving the keyboard between the two people quickly at all times - I have certainly seen times where it makes sense for one person to be spending more time at the keyboard than the other.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written previously about my dislike of the way the object initialiser is misused in C# 3.0 and although I&amp;rsquo;ve also written about my preference for explicit modeling and the need for objects to act as good citizens I&amp;rsquo;ve never quite been able to articulate what it is I dislike so much about having setter methods on objects.
I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt from experience that it leads to a world of pain in our code by having the ability to setup an object after construction using setters and in a conversation with a colleague about this last week he suggested that the reason it&amp;rsquo;s such a bad practice to follow is that it makes us lose our trust in not only that object but in all the other objects in the application.</description>

      <description>We decided to play around with Smalltalk a bit in our latest coding dojo.
A lot of the ideas that I value the most in terms of writing software effectively seem to have originally come from the Smalltalk community and a colleague of mine has been reading Kent Beck&amp;rsquo;s TDD by Example book and was really keen to try out the language to see where Kent&amp;rsquo;s original ideas came from.</description>

      <description>One of the things that we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on lately to improve the overall time that our full build takes to run is to split the acceptance tests into several small groups of tests so that we can run them in parallel.
We are using Cruise as our build server so the ability to have multiple agents running against different parts of the build at the same time comes built it.</description>

      <title>F#: Object expressions</title>

      <description>One of the things I miss a bit from the Java world is the ability to create anonymous inner classes which implement a certain interface.
We can&amp;rsquo;t do this in C# - you always need to define a named class - but in my latest playing around with F# I was quite pleased to learn that we do have this ability using a feature called object expressions.
These come in particularly useful when you are only making use of the implementation of an interface in one place in the code and therefore don&amp;rsquo;t want to expose this type to any other code.</description>

      <description>The Book 97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know by Richard Monson-Haefel
The Review My colleague Erik Doernenburg mentioned that he had written a couple of chapters in this book a while ago and there was a copy of the book in the ThoughtWorks office so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d take a look.
I&amp;rsquo;m far from being an architect but since their decisions affect what I do I was intrigued to see what they should be doing.</description>

      <description>We decided to have a second week of following Keith Braithwaite&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;TDD as if you meant it&amp;rsquo; exercise which he led at the Software Craftsmanship Conference.
Our attempt a fortnight ago was around implementing a Flash Message interceptor, to hook into the Spring framework but this week was focused more around modeling, the goal being to model a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
The code is available on our bitbucket repository.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with Mercurial and the mercurial hosting website bitbucket a bit this year and recently wanted to pull from a repository from behind a proxy server.
With a bit of help from the mercurial mailing list and the documentation this is how I was able to pull the repository for the Hambread project I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a bit of work on:
~~~text
hg &amp;ndash;config http_proxy.host=ipOfYourProxyServer:portOfYourProxyServer &amp;ndash;config http_proxy.user=user &amp;ndash;config http_proxy.</description>

      <description>When debugging a problem I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt far too many times that where possible the most effective approach is to try and get the application back into a state where it does work and then analyse the changes that have resulted in it no longer working as expected.
About 7 or 8 years ago when I used to code PHP at school and university that pretty much was my default approach - I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know how to program well enough to work out how to fix something that was broken so I would always just revert back all the steps I&amp;rsquo;d done until it worked.</description>

      <description>I wrote previously about the idea of tackling the risky tasks in a project early on - an idea that I learnt about when reading Alistair Cockburn&amp;rsquo;s Crystal Clear.
Towards the end of the post I wondered whether we could apply this idea at a story level whereby we would identify the potentially risky parts of a story and make sure that we addressed those risks before they became problematic to us.</description>

      <description>Josh has been teaching me how to do regular expressions in Javascript this week and intrigued as to how you would do this in F# I came across a couple of blog posts by Chris Smith talking about active patterns and regular expressions via active patterns.
As I understand them active patterns are not that much different to normal functions but we can make use of them as part of a let or match statement which we can&amp;rsquo;t do with a normal function.</description>

      <title>C#: Using virtual leads to confusion?</title>

      <description>A colleague and I were looking through some code that I worked on a couple of months ago where I had created a one level hierarchy using inheritance to represent the response status that we get back from a service call.
The code was along these lines:
public class ResponseStatus { public static readonly ResponseStatus TransactionSuccessful = new TransactionSuccessful(); public static readonly ResponseStatus UnrecoverableError = new UnrecoverableError(); public virtual bool RedirectToErrorPage { get { return true; } } } public class UnrecoverableError : ResponseStatus { } public class TransactionSuccessful : ResponseStatus { public override bool RedirectToErrorPage { get { return false; } } }  Looking at it now it does seem a bit over-engineered, but the main confusion with this code is that when you click through to the definition of &amp;lsquo;RedirectToError&amp;rsquo; it goes to the ResponseStatus version of that property and it&amp;rsquo;s not obvious that it is being overridden in a sub class, this being possible due to my use of the virtual key word.</description>

      <description>Pat Kua has a recent post where he talks about the language used between testers and developers when talking about defects that testers come across when testing some functionality and while I would agree with him that the language used is important, I&amp;rsquo;ve always found that injecting some humour into the situation takes the edge off.
As Dahlia points out I think this is probably only possible if there is good rapport between the developers and testers on the team so perhaps this has been the case for the teams I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a bit of a discussion recently with some of my colleagues about what we should do when pair programming and one of the people in the pair has to step away to go and help someone else or to take part in an estimation session or whatever it happens to be.
If we&amp;rsquo;re pairing in an effective way then it should be possible for the person still at the computer to keep on going on the story/task that the pair were working on alone.</description>

      <description>Coming from the world of C# I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that there are a couple of things that I sometimes get confused about when playing around with stuff in F# land.
Passing arguments to functions The way that we pass arguments to functions seems to be a fairly constant cause of confusion at the moment especially when doing that as part of a chain of other expressions where the use of brackets starts to become necessary.</description>

      <description>In an attempt to see whether or not the mailboxes I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for my twitter application were actually processing messages on different threads I ran into the problem of defining the entry point of an F# application.
I thought it would be as simple as defining a function called &amp;lsquo;main&amp;rsquo; but I put this function into my code ran the executable and nothing happened!
Googling the problem a bit led me to believe that it is possible to do but that the function needs to be the last thing that happens in the compilation sequence of the project.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my previous post about over loading methods in F# I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to refactor my twitter application into a state where it can concurrently process twitter statuses while continuing to retrieve more of them from the twitter website.
I played around a bit with Erlang last year and one thing that I quite liked is the message passing between processes to allow operations to be performed concurrently.</description>

      <description>While trying to refactor my twitter application into a state where I could use Erlang style message passing to process some requests asynchronously while still hitting twitter to get more messages I came across the problem of wanting to overload a method.
By default it seems that you can&amp;rsquo;t do method overloading in F# unless you make use of the OverloadID attribute which I learnt about from reading Scott Seely&amp;rsquo;s blog post:</description>

      <description>An interesting problem that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a few times in the last couple of week centres around how strongly typed we should make the arguments to public methods on our objects.
There seem to be benefits and drawbacks with each approach so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure which approach is better - it possibly depends on the context.
When we have a strong API the idea is that we pass an object as the argument to a method on another object.</description>

      <description>While continuing playing with my F# twitter application I was trying to work out how to exclude the tweets that I posted from the list that gets displayed.
I actually originally had the logic the wrong way round so that it was only showing my tweets!
let excludeSelf (statuses:seq&amp;lt;TwitterStatus&amp;gt;) = statuses |&amp;gt; Seq.filter (fun eachStatus -&amp;gt; eachStatus.User.ScreenName.Equals(&amp;quot;markhneedham&amp;quot;))  Coming from the world of Java and C# &amp;lsquo;!&amp;rsquo; would be the operator to find the screen names that don&amp;rsquo;t match my own name.</description>

The majority of what Pavel says I&amp;rsquo;ve seen happen before on projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on but I disagree with his suggestion that writing unit tests is boring:
 6. Writing unit tests is boring. That’s not amusing or challenging algorithmic problem. That’s not cool hacking trick which you can show off with in front of your geeky friends.</description>

      <description>From my experiences playing around with F# and doing a bit of functional C# I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to think that the combination of functional and object oriented programming actually results in code which I think is more expressive and easy to work with than code written only with an object oriented approach in mind.
I&amp;rsquo;m also finding it much more fun to write code this way!
In a recent post Dean Wampler questions whether the supremacy of object oriented programming is over before going on to suggest that the future is probably going to be a mix of functional programming and object oriented programming.</description>

He&amp;rsquo;ll also be presenting it at JAOO in Sydney and Brisbane in a couple of weeks time.
The slides for the talk are here and it&amp;rsquo;s also available on InfoQ.
What did I learn?  I quite liked the way the talk was laid out - Dan laid out a series of problems that he&#39;s seen on some projects he&#39;s worked on and then showed on the next slide where he planned to take the architecture.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite parts of the Domain Driven Design book is where Eric Evans talks about making implicit concepts in our domain model explicit.
The book describes this process like so:
 Many transformations of domain models and the corresponding code happen when developers recognize a concept that has been hinted at in discussion or present implicitly in the design, and they then represent it explicitly in the model with one or more objects or relationships.</description>

The Review I heard about this book a while ago but I was intrigued to actually get a copy by Darren Cotterill, the Iteration Manager on the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on at the moment.
I was particularly interested in learning whether the ideas of agile and/or lean help to solve any of these dysfunctions.
What did I learn?  The book is split into two sections.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve found this to be a very valuable way of learning - in fact it&amp;rsquo;s probably more beneficial to the teacher than the student, somewhat ironically.</description>

      <description>One interesting situation that we often arrive at when writing code is working out when the best time to apply a level of abstraction is.
I think there is always a trade off to be made when it comes to creating abstractions - creating the abstraction adds to the complexity of the code we&amp;rsquo;re writing but it is often the case that creating it makes it easier for us to navigate the code base.</description>

      <description>I recently read a blog post by Joshua Lockwood where he spoke of some people who claim they don&amp;rsquo;t have time to test.
Learning the TDD approach to writing code has been one of best things that I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt over the last few years - before I worked at ThoughtWorks I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to do it and the only way I could verify whether something worked was to load up the application and manually check it.</description>

      <description>I previously wrote about a little twitter application I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing to go through my twitter feed and find only the tweets with links it and while it works I realised that I was finding it quite difficult to add any additional functionality to it.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been following the examples in Real World Functional Programming which has encouraged an approach of creating functions to do everything that you want to do and then mixing them together.</description>

      <description>In our latest coding dojo we worked on trying to port some of the functionality of some C# 1.0 brain models, and in particular one around simulating chaos behaviour, that Dave worked on at university.
The Format This was more of an experimental dojo since everyone was fairly new to F# so we didn&amp;rsquo;t rotate the pair at the keyboard as frequently as possible.
What We Learnt  The aim of the session was to try and put some unit tests around the C# code and then try and replace that code with an F# version of it piece by piece.</description>

      <description>I recently finished reading Lean Thinking and one of the things that was repeatedly emphasised is the need to look at the process as a whole rather than trying to optimise each part individually.
If we phrased this in a similar way to the Agile Manifesto it would probably read &amp;lsquo;Big Picture over Local Optimisations&amp;rsquo;.
The examples in Lean Thinking tend to be more manufacturing focused but I think this idea can certainly be applied in thinking about software projects too.</description>

      <description>I spent most of the bank holiday Monday here in Sydney writing a little application to scan through my twitter feed and find me just the tweets which have links in them since for me that&amp;rsquo;s where a lot of the value of twitter lies.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure someone has done this already but it seemed like a good opportunity to try and put a little of the F# that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from reading Real World Functional Programming to use.</description>

      <description>I wrote previously about creating DRY tests and after some conversations with my colleagues recently about the balance between reducing duplication but maintaining readability I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found the compromise between the two that works best for me.
The underlying idea is that in any unit test I want to be aiming for a distinct 3 sections in the test - Given/When/Then, Arrange/Act/Assert or whatever your favourite description for those is.</description>

      <description>The Book The Mythical Man Month by Fred Brooks Junior
The Review Pretty much since I started working at ThoughtWorks 2 1&amp;frasl;2 years ago I&amp;rsquo;ve been told that this is a book I have to read and I&amp;rsquo;ve finally got around to doing so.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not that surprising but my overriding thought about the book is that just about every mistake that we make in software development today is covered in this book!</description>

      <description>One of the hardest situations that comes up when pair programming is when you want to solve a problem in a certain way but you can&amp;rsquo;t persuade your pair that it&amp;rsquo;s the approach you should take.
The temptation in these situations is to wait until your pair isn&amp;rsquo;t around, maybe by staying late at the end of the day or coming in early the next day and then making the changes to the code that you wanted to make but didn&amp;rsquo;t when you were pairing with them.</description>

      <description>In a post I wrote a couple of days ago about understanding the context of a piece of code before criticising it, one of the examples that I used of a time when it seems fine to break a rule was passing a boolean into a method to determine whether or not to show an editable version of a control on the page.
Chatting with Nick about this yesterday it became clear to me that I&amp;rsquo;ve missed one important reason why you&amp;rsquo;d not want to pass a boolean into a method.</description>

      <description>One of the things I find a bit confusing when it comes to Domain Driven Design is that some of the higher profile speakers/user group contributors on the subject have expressed the opinion that DDD is more suitable when we are dealing with complex projects.
I think this means complex in terms of the domain but I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly worked on some projects where we&amp;rsquo;ve been following certainly some of the ideas of DDD and have got some value out of doing so in domains which I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say were particularly complex.</description>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2009/04/05/coding-criticising-without-context/</guid>
      <description>I think one of the easiest things to do as a developer is to look at some code that you didn&amp;rsquo;t write and then start trashing it for all the supposed mistakes that the author has made that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have.
It&amp;rsquo;s certainly something I&amp;rsquo;ve been guilty of doing and probably will be again in the future.
Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s justified but most of the time we lack the context for understanding why the code was written the way it was and therefore our criticism is not very useful to anyone.</description>

      <description>While reading Real World Functional Programming I came across an interesting pattern that I have noticed in some code bases recently which I liked but didn&amp;rsquo;t know had been given a name!
The hole in the middle pattern, coined by Brian Hurt, shows a cool way of using higher order functions in order to reuse code in cases where the code typically looks something like this:
public void SomeServiceCall() { var serviceClient = CreateServiceClient(); try { serviceClient.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve previously written about some of the aspects of the mapping efforts that we&amp;rsquo;ve done on recent projects and what we&amp;rsquo;ve found from our testing (or lack of) around this type of code is that somewhere along the line you are going to have to check that you&amp;rsquo;re mapping these values correctly, be it in an automated test or just by manually checking that the correct values are being sent across our integration points and into other systems.</description>

      <description>I recently watched a video recorded by Uncle Bob at the Chicago Alt.NET meeting where amongst other things he talked about the importance of going slowly but surely when we&amp;rsquo;re developing code i.e. spending the time to get it right first time instead of rushing through and having to go back and fix our mistakes.
While pairing with a colleague recently it became clear to me that pair programming, when done well, drives you towards a state where you are being much more careful about the work being produced.</description>

      <description>One of the big takeaways for me from the Domain Driven Design track at the recent QCon London conference was that the organisational patterns in the second half of the book are probably more important than the actual patterns themselves.
There are various patterns used to describe the relationships between different bounded contexts:
 Shared Kernel - This is where two teams share some subset of the domain model. This shouldn&#39;t be changed without the other team being consulted.</description>

      <description>I recently watched a presentation about lean thinking and I started seeing parallels in a lot of what they were saying with the benefits that I believe we see in projects when the team pair programs.
Big Picture vs Local Optimisations One of the biggest arguments used against pair programming is that we get half as much work done because we have two people working on one computer.
Even if we ignore the immediate flaws in that argument I think this is a case of looking at individual productivity when in fact what we really care about is the team&amp;rsquo;s productivity i.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started playing around with F# again and decided to try and create some unit tests around the examples I&amp;rsquo;m following from Real World Functional Programming. After reading Matt Podwysocki&amp;rsquo;s blog post about XUnit.NET I decided that would probably be the best framework for me to use.
The example I&amp;rsquo;m writing tests around is:
let convertDataRow(str:string) = let cells = List.of_seq(str.Split([|&#39;,&#39;|])) match cells with | label::value::_ -&amp;gt; let numericValue = Int32.</description>

      <description>One of the fairly standard ways of shielding our applications when integrating with other systems is to create a wrapper around it so that all interaction with it is in one place.
As I mentioned in a previous post we have been using the repository pattern to achieve this in our code.
One service which we needed to integrate lately provided data for populating data on drop downs on our UI so the service provided two pieces of data - a Value (which needed to be sent to another service when a certain option was selected) and a Label (which was the value for us to display on the screen).</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some work to get our views in ASP.NET MVC to be pre-compiled which allows us to see any errors in them at compilation rather than at run time.
It&amp;rsquo;s relatively simple to do. You just need to add the following code into your .csproj file anywhere below the  element:
&amp;lt;Target Name=&amp;quot;AfterBuild&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;AspNetCompiler VirtualPath=&amp;quot;/&amp;quot; PhysicalPath=&amp;quot;$(ProjectDir)\..\$(ProjectName)&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/Target&amp;gt;  where VirtualPath refers to the virtual path defined inside your project file and PhysicalPath is the path to the folder which contains the project with the views in.</description>

One of my favourites is an interview featuring Joe Armstrong and Eric Meijer where Joe Armstrong points out that when coding Erlang he never has to use a debugger because state is immutable.
In Erlang, once you set the value of a variable &amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo; it cannot be changed.</description>

      <description>The Book Lean Thinking by James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones
The Review This is the latest book in my lean learning after The Toyota Way, Taiichi Ohno&amp;rsquo;s Workplace Management and Lean Software Development and seemed like the most logical one to read next as it came at lean from a slightly different angle.
I found this the most hard going of the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read on the subject so far.</description>

      <description>When I first started programming in a &amp;lsquo;proper&amp;rsquo; IDE one of the things that I thought was really cool was the ability to debug through my code whenever something wasn&amp;rsquo;t working quite the way I expected it to.
Now the debugger is not a completely pointless tool - indeed there is sometimes no other easy way to work out what&amp;rsquo;s going wrong - but I think it now becomes the default problem solver whenever a bit of code is not working as we expect it to.</description>

      <description>An interesting thing that I&amp;rsquo;ve started to notice recently with regards to software development books is that I get a lot more from reading the book the second time compared to what I did reading the book the first time.
I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed this for several books, including The Pragmatic Programmer, Code Complete and Domain Driven Design, so my first thought was that perhaps I had read this books too early when I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the necessary context or experience to gain value from reading them.</description>

      <description>One of the lessons that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned the more projects I work on is that the most important thing to do when coding is to do so in a way that you make life easier for the next person who has to come across that code, be it yourself or one of your team mates.
I think the underlying idea is that we need to make things as obvious as possible.</description>

      <description>The final Domain Driven Design talk I attended at QCon was by Dan Bergh Johnsson about the importance of value objects in our code.
I thought this session fitted in really well as a couple of the previous speakers had spoken of the under utilisation of value objects.
The slides for the presentation are here.
What did I learn?  Dan started the talk by outlining the goal for the presentation which was to &#39;show how power use of value objects can radically change design and code, hopefully for the better&#39;.</description>

      <description>Talk #3 on the Domain Driven Design track at QCon was by Phil Wills about how the Guardian rebuilt their website using Domain Driven Design.
I&amp;rsquo;d heard a little bit about this beforehand from colleagues who had the chance to work on that project but it seemed like a good opportunity to hear a practical example and the lessons learned along the way.
There are no slides available for this one on the QCon website at the moment.</description>

Eric did an interview with Greg at QCon San Francisco 2007 where Greg talks about some of his ideas and apparently there is an InfoQ video kicking around of Greg&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Unshackle Your Domain&amp;rsquo; talk from QCon San Francisco 2008 which we were told to pester InfoQ to post on their website!</description>

      <description>I went to the QCon conference in London on Thursday, spending the majority of the day on Eric Evans&amp;rsquo; Domain Driven Design track.
The opening presentation was by Eric Evans, himself, and was titled &amp;lsquo;What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about DDD since the book&amp;rsquo;.
 In the 5 years since the book was published, I&#39;ve practiced DDD on various client projects, and I&#39;ve continued to learn about what works, what doesn&#39;t work, and how to conceptualize and describe it all.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in the world of professional software development for a few years now and pretty much take it as a given that the best way to write code which is easy for other people to understand and work with is to write that code in an object oriented way.
Not everyone agrees with this approach of course and I&amp;rsquo;ve been told on occasions that I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;lsquo;over object orienting&amp;rsquo; (is that even a word?</description>

      <description>Micro or Tiny types present an approach to coding which seems to divide opinion in my experience, from those who think it&amp;rsquo;s a brilliant idea to those who believe it&amp;rsquo;s static typing gone mad.
I fall into the former group.
So what is it?
The idea is fairly simple - all primitives and strings in our code are wrapped by a class, meaning that we never pass primitives around.

      <description>The Repository pattern from Domain Driven Design is one of the cleanest ways I have come across for separating our domain objects from their persistence mechanism.
Until recently every single implementation I had seen of this pattern involved directly using a database as the persistence mechanism with the repository acting as a wrapper around the Object Relational Mapper (Hibernate/NHibernate).
Now I consider there to be two parts to the repository pattern:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Casey Charlton&amp;rsquo;s excellent series of posts on Domain Driven Design recently and today came across his thoughts about which types of applications Domain Driven Design is suited to.
Towards the end of the post he talks about the fact that there is a lot of excellent ideas in Domain Driven Design even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the chance to use all of them.
 ...there is a wealth of wisdom and experience encapsulated in Domain Driven Design – use what you think applies to your situation, and you will find your software becoming more flexible, more reactive to your audience, and easier to understand – just don’t expect miracles, and beware of over complicating your code for the sake of it – sometimes simpler really is better.</description>

      <description>In our latest coding dojo we attempted to code Isola in Javascript but instead of coding from the board inwards we decided to try and take the approach of coding from the cells outwards to keep it interesting.
My colleague brought in his copy of the game and it made it much easier to imagine how we should be modeling it by having the game in front of us.

      <description>I was recently reading Brad Cross&amp;rsquo; recent post about creating objects which are Good Citizens in code and he certainly nails one aspect of this with regards to ensuring that our objects are in a usable state post construction.
 In OO design, an object is considered to be a good citizen if it is in a fully composed and usable state post-construction. This means that once the constructor exits, the class is ready to use - without the need to call additional setters or init() methods.</description>

      <title>ASP.NET MVC: Reducing duplication for partial models</title>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2009/03/03/aspnet-mvc-using-adaptors-for-partial-models/</guid>
      <description>One of the problems we can encounter when using partials throughout our views is how we should create the model needed for those partials.
The approach that we have been following is to have the partial/child model on the parent model and then just call the appropriate method where we create the partial.
e.g.
public class ParentModel { public string Property1 {get;set;} public ChildModel ChildModel { get;set; } } public class ChildModel { public string Property1 {get;set;} }  We have sometimes run into the problem where the data in the ChildModel is being populated from the ParentModel (due to it also being needed there) leading to data duplication.</description>

      <description>As we know with software development with pretty much every decision we make or technology we choose there is a trade off that goes with making this choice as compared with choosing an alternative.
I first learnt this when working with Ade a couple of years ago and while I know it to be true, I had come to believe that some practices are just non-negotiable and we should look to apply them judiciously wherever possible.</description>

      <description>I recently started playing around with Scott Bellware&amp;rsquo;s Spec-Unit and Aaron&amp;rsquo;s Jensen&amp;rsquo;s MSpec, two frameworks which both provide a way of writing Context/Spec style tests/specifications.
What I particularly like about this approach to writing tests is that we can divide assertions into specific blocks and have them all evaluated even if an earlier one fails.
NUnit is our testing tool of choice at the moment and we wanted to try and find a way to test the mapping between the domain and service layers of the application.</description>

      <title>Coding: Implicit vs Explicit modeling </title>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2009/02/28/coding-implicit-vs-explicit-modeling/</guid>
      <description>When it comes to object modeling there seem to be two distinct approaches that I have come across.
Implicit modeling The first approach is where we do what I like to think of as implicit modeling.
With this approach we would probably use less objects than in the explicit approach and we would have objects being populated as we moved through the work flow of our application.
I call it implicit modeling because we need to imply where we are based on the internal state of our objects - we can typically work this out by seeing what is and is not set to null.</description>

      <description>An interesting conversation I&amp;rsquo;ve had recently with some of my colleagues is around the use of the ToString method available on all objects created in Java or C#. It was also pointed out in the comments on my recent post about wrapping DateTimes in our code.
I think the original intention of this method was to create a string representation of an object, but its use has been overloaded by developers to the point where its expected use is as a mechanism for creating nice output when debugging the code or viewing unit test failures.</description>

      <description>I think it was Darren Hobbs who first introduced me to the idea of wrapping dates in our system to describe what that date actually means in our context, and after suffering the pain of passing some unwrapped dates around our code I think I can safely say that wrapping them is the way to go.
The culprit was a date of birth which was sometimes being created from user input and sometimes being retrieved from another system.</description>

      <description>Another interesting thing I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed in C# world is that there seems to be a trend towards using extension methods as much as possible. One area where this is particularly prevalent is when working with collections.
From reading Object Calisthenics and working with Nick I have got used to wrapping collections and defining methods on the wrapped class for interacting with the underlying collection.
For example, given that we have a collection of Foos that we need to use in our system we might wrap that in an object Foos.</description>

      <description>Since it was pointed out in the comments on an earlier post I wrote about using the builder pattern how useful the implicit operator could be in this context we&amp;rsquo;ve been using it wherever it makes sense.
The main benefit that using this approach provides is that our test code becomes more expressive since we don&amp;rsquo;t need to explicitly call a method to complete the building of our object.
public class FooBuilder { private string bar = &amp;quot;defaultBar&amp;quot;; public FooBuilder Bar(string value) { bar = value; return this; } public static implicit operator Foo(FooBuilder builder) { return new Foo { Bar = builder.</description>

      <description>I like to have conventions in the code I write - I find it makes the code i write much cleaner which still providing flexibility.
One of the conventions that Jeremy Miller coined for working with ASP.NET MVC applications is that of using one model per controller method aka &amp;ldquo;The Thunderdome principle&amp;rdquo;. I think we can take this further by having one model per partial that we use inside our views.</description>

      <description>When I first heard about extension methods in C# it sounded like a pretty cool idea but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how they differed to the idea of open classes that I had seen when doing a bit of Ruby.
After a bit of a struggle recently to try and override some extension methods on HtmlHelper in ASP.NET MVC it&amp;rsquo;s clear to me that we don&amp;rsquo;t quite have the same power that open classes would provide.</description>

Kent Beck&amp;rsquo;s definition of collective code ownership is that
 Anyone can change anything at anytime  Mike also gives an alternative definition which goes beyond that:
 From a more measurable POV, CoCO states that everyone on the team (developer-wise) must be able to describe the design of anything the team is working on in no more than 5 minutes.</description>

      <description>The object initializer syntax introduced in C# 3.0 makes it easier for us to initialise our objects in one statement but I think we need to remember that they are not named parameters and that there is still a place (a very good one actually) for creating objects from constructors or factory methods.
Unfortunately what I think the cleaner syntax does is encourage us to create objects with half the fields populated and half of them null by default.</description>

      <description>I previously wrote about protecting websites from cross site scripting in the ASP.NET MVC framework by encoding user input when we are going to display it in the browser.
We can either choose to encode data like this or we can encode it straight away when we get it.
There did not seem to be a consensus on the best approach in a discussion on the ASP.NET forums but we believe it is far better to encode the data when it is outgoing rather than incoming.</description>

      <description>While browsing through the ASP.NET MVC source I noticed that they use an interesting pattern on the constructors to ensure that an exception will be thrown if an object is not instantiated correctly.
public ControllerContext(HttpContextBase httpContext, RouteData routeData, ControllerBase controller) : base(httpContext, routeData) { if (controller == null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(&amp;quot;controller&amp;quot;); } Controller = controller; }  If you pass in a null Controller you shall go no further!</description>

      <description>Our latest coding dojo involved refactoring the code we wrote a couple of weeks ago for the board game Isola.
We started a repository on Bit Bucket to store our code from these sessions.
The Format We used the Randori approach again with four people participating for the whole session.
What We Learnt  Last time we had spent most of our time purely making the code functional so all the objects were completely mutable.</description>

      <title>C#: Properties vs Methods</title>

      <description>I was browsing through our tests today and noticed a test along these lines (simplified for example purposes):
[Test, ExpectedException(typeof(Exception))] public void ShouldThrowExceptionIfNoBarSet() { var bar = new Foo(null).Bar; }  public class Foo { private readonly string bar; public Foo(string bar) { this.bar = bar; } public string Bar { get { if (bar == null) { throw new Exception(&amp;quot;No bar&amp;quot;); } return bar; } } }  What I found strange here is that &amp;lsquo;bar&amp;rsquo; is never used and Resharper points out as much.</description>

      <title>Agile: Re-estimating cards</title>

      <description>Chris Johnston has another interesting post in which he writes about the practice of re-estimating cards after they have been completed.
I think this somewhat misses the point that the estimate is indeed supposed to be an estimate. It might turn out to be too optimistic or too pessimistic, the theory being that overall we will end up with a reasonable balance that will allow us to make a prediction on how much work we believe we can complete in a certain time period.</description>

      <description>My colleague Chris Johnston wrote recently about his experiences in agile software development, posing some questions that he has.
Specifically:
 Why comments are evil? Why design is evil? Why must you pair all the time? Why Agile principles become Agile rules?  Now I&amp;rsquo;m assuming that most (if not all) of Chris&amp;rsquo; experiences with agile have been at ThoughtWorks, in which case the mix of agile we use on our projects tends to be a combination of Scrum and Extreme Programming.</description>

      <title>OOP: What does an object&#39;s responsibility entail?</title>

      <description>One of the interesting discussions I&amp;rsquo;ve been having recently with some colleagues is around where the responsibility lies for describing the representation of an object when it is to be used in another bounded context - e.g. on the user interface or in a call to another system.
I believe that an object should be responsible for deciding how its data is used rather than having another object reach into it, retrieve its data and then decide what to do with it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading the transcript of Joel Spolsky/Jeff Atwood&amp;rsquo;s podcast discussion on TDD/Quality and related posts on the subject by Uncle Bob and Ron Jeffries and while I guess it&amp;rsquo;s fairly inevitable that I&amp;rsquo;m likely to side with the latter two, what I&amp;rsquo;ve realised is that I get the greatest enjoyment from my job when we are writing high quality software.
Certainly delivering value to customers in a timely manner is important but if we&amp;rsquo;re not producing something that we&amp;rsquo;re proud to have written then I think we&amp;rsquo;re doing ourselves and our customer a disservice.</description>

      <title>Refactoring: Comment it out vs small steps removal</title>

      <description>One refactoring I was doing last week was to try and remove the use of some getters/setters on one of our objects so that it was better encapsulated and all the behaviour related to it happened in one place.
The change involved introducing a constructor to initialise the object rather than doing so using the new object initialiser syntax and initalising it using the properties.
My initial approach was to find all the usages of these properties and then remove each usage one by one, running our suite of tests against the code after each change to ensure that nothing had broken as a result of the change.</description>

      <title>Agile: Why do we integrate early?</title>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2009/02/06/agile-why-do-we-integrate-early/</guid>
      <description>One of the inevitabilities of most projects is that at some stage there is going to need be some sort of integration.
The likes of Alistair Cockburn in Crystal Clear and Andy Hunt/Dave Thomas in The Pragmatic Programmer talk of the need to do integration early rather than letting it wait until later, but why?
Get the pain out the way To some degree every time we try to integrate there is going to be some level of pain - for me it therefore makes sense that we take this pain early on when we have the chance to do something about it rather than leaving it until later and being surprised at the problems it causes.</description>

      <title>C#: Public fields vs automatic properties </title>

      <description>An interesting new feature in C# 3.0 is that of automatic properties on objects - this allows us to define a get/set property and the creation of the underlying field is taken care off for us.
We can therefore create a class like this:
public class Foo { public string Bar { get; set; } }  Now ignoring the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s terrible OO to write a class like that, one thing that we&amp;rsquo;ve been wondering is what&amp;rsquo;s the difference between doing the above and just creating a public field on Foo called Bar like so:</description>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2009/02/03/nant-include-task-namespace-matters/</guid>
      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to include some properties into our build file from a properties file today but no matter what we tried the properties were not being set.
We eventually realised that the build file has an XML Namespace set on the project element.
&amp;lt;project name=&amp;quot;...&amp;quot; xmlns=&amp;quot;http://nant.sf.net/schemas/nant.xsd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;  It turns out that if you want to include a properties file in your build file, like so:
&amp;lt;include buildfile=&amp;quot;properties.xml&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  &amp;hellip;you need to put the namespace on the project attribute of that file as well, otherwise its properties don&amp;rsquo;t get picked up.</description>

      <description>I wrote about a month or so ago about the functional collection parameters now available in C# and certainly one of the most fun refactorings for me is trying to get code written using a for loop into a state where it is using one of these.
With a bit of help from my colleague James Crisp, these are some of the most common refactorings that I have come across so far.</description>

      <description>Our latest coding dojo involved writing the board game Isola in Java.
The Format We used the Randori approach again with around 8 or 9 people participating for the majority of the session, our biggest turnout yet. I think the majority of people had the opportunity to drive a couple of times over the evening.
We had the pair driving at the front of the room and everyone else further back to stop the tendency of observers to whiteboard stuff.</description>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2009/01/30/tdd-test-dryness/</guid>
      <description>I had a discussion recently with Fabio about DRYness in our tests and how we don&amp;rsquo;t tend to adhere to this principal as often in test code as in production code.
I think certainly some of the reason for this is that we don&amp;rsquo;t take as much care of our test code as we do production code but for me at least some of it is down to the fact that if we make our tests too DRY then they become very difficult to read and perhaps more importantly, very difficult to debug when there is a failure.</description>

      <description>As with most code, tests are read many more times than they are written and as the majority of the time the reason for reading them is to identify a test failure I think it makes sense that we should be designing our tests with failure in mind.
Several ideas come to mind when thinking about ways to write/design our tests so that when we do have to read them our task is made easier.</description>

      <description>One of the things that I have been curious about since we started running coding dojos is whether people learn more effectively alone or when learning as part of a group.
Not that I think they are mutually exclusive, I think a combination of both is probably the way to go depending on what it is we are trying to learn and the way that we&amp;rsquo;re trying to learn it.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a bit of work with jQuery and true to our TDD roots we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to work out the best way to test drive our coding in this area.
There seem to be 3 main ways that you can go about doing this, regardless of the testing framework you choose to you. We are using screw-unit for our javascript testing.
Mock everything out The idea here is that we mock out all calls made to jQuery functions and then we assert that the expected calls were made in our test.</description>

      <description>I had thought that with the ability to use the new object initalizer syntax in C# 3.0 meant that the builder pattern was now no longer necessary but some recent refactoring efforts have made me believe otherwise.
My original thought was that the builder pattern was really useful for providing a nicely chained way of creating objects, but after a bit of discussion with some colleagues I have come across three different reasons why we might want to use the builder pattern to create test data:</description>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2009/01/19/cruise-pipelining-for-fast-visual-feedback/</guid>
      <description>One of the cool features in build servers like Cruise and Team City is the ability to create build pipelines.
I have done a bit of work using this feature in previous projects but the key driver for doing so there was to create a chain of producers/consumers (producing and consuming artifacts) eventually resulting in a manual step to put the application into a testing environment.
While this is certainly a good reason to create a build pipeline, a colleague pointed out an equally useful way of using this feature to split the build into separate steps pipelined together.</description>

      <description>If you hang around a team practicing XP for long enough, one of the phrases you are bound to hear is YAGNI (You Ain&amp;rsquo;t Gonna Need It).
Although it can sometimes be used to ignore things we don&amp;rsquo;t want to focus on as Ian points out, in general the aim is to stop people from working on code that isn&amp;rsquo;t currently required.
So assuming our team isn&amp;rsquo;t being lazy and trying to avoid decisions that they don&amp;rsquo;t want to think about, why do we hear the YAGNI call and more importantly, perhaps, what happens when we don&amp;rsquo;t heed that call.</description>

      <description>An idea which is considered common sense by most developers but which is not always adhered to is that of not commenting out code.
Code is nearly always under source control anyway so commenting out code which is not being used doesn&amp;rsquo;t really serve any positive purpose and it can have quite a few negative effects.
Clutter Ideally we should be able to read through the code without too much confusion - each method&amp;rsquo;s name being descriptive enough that we can work out what is going on.</description>

      <description>In my continued reading of F# one of the ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve come across recently is that of partial function application.
This is a way of allowing us to combine different functions together and allows some quite powerful syntax to be written.
The term &amp;lsquo;currying&amp;rsquo; is perhaps a better known term for describing this although as I understand they are not exactly the same.
Currying is where we return a function that has been partially applied, in such a way that we can chain together a group of functions with a single argument.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some work this week around trying to ensure that we have a ubiquitous language to describe aspects of the domain across the various different systems on my project.
It&amp;rsquo;s not easy as there are several different teams involved but one thing we realised while working on the language is that the language of the business is not the same as the language of the user.
Although this is the first time that I recall working on a project where the language of the user is different to the language of the domain I&amp;rsquo;m sure there must be other domains where this is the case as well.</description>

      <description>Technical debt is a term coined by Martin Fowler which we tend to use on our projects to describe a number of different situations on projects as Ian Cartwright points out in his post on the subject.
Ian covers it in more detail, but to summarise my understanding of what technical debt actually is:
 Technical debt is where we know that something we choose not to take care of now is going to affect us in the future.</description>

      <description>We ran our 5th coding dojo on Thursday night, writing the card game Uno in Java. We didn&amp;rsquo;t all know the rules so this video explained it - surely a parody but you never know!
The Format We used the Randori approach again with 6 people participating for the majority of the session. Everyone paired with everyone else at least once and sometimes a couple of times.
We had the pair driving at the front of the room and everyone else further back to stop the tendency of observers to whiteboard stuff.</description>

      <title>Javascript Dates - Be aware of mutability</title>

      <description>It seems that much like in Java, dates in Javascript are mutable, meaning that it is possible to change a date after it has been created.
We had this painfully shown to us when using the datejs library to manipulate some dates.
The erroneous code was similar to this:
var jan312009 = new Date(2008, 1-1, 31); var oneMonthFromJan312009 = new Date(jan312009.add(1).month());  See the subtle error? Outputting these two values gives the following:</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a bit of date manipulation in Javascript on my current project and one of the things that we wanted to do is add 1 month to a given date.
We can kind of achieve this using the standard date libraries but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for edge cases.
For example, say we want to add one month to January 31st 2009. We would expect one month from this date to be February 28th 2009:</description>

      <description>The Book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell
The Review I came across this book following recommendations by Jason Yip and Steven &amp;lsquo;Doc&amp;rsquo; List on Twitter.
I&amp;rsquo;ve previously read The Tipping Point and Blink and I like his easy going style so it was a no brainer that I was going to read this one.
I found that this book complimented Talent is Overrated quite nicely. Outliers covers how the story of how people became the best at what they do whereas Talent is Overrated focuses more on what you need to do if you want to become one of these people.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been using the jQuery datepicker on my current project and came across some strange behaviour with regards to the positioning of the calendar in IE6.
The calendar was always positioning itself right at the top of the screen instead of just below the textbox it was hooked up to but in Firefox it was working fine.
After a bit of exploration in the jQuery code (ui.datepicker.js) we worked out that the &amp;lsquo;document.</description>

      <description>Continuing on my F# journey I came across a post by Ben Hall describing the approach he takes when learning a new programming language.
One of the approaches he describes is that of writing unit tests to help keep your learning on track. I&amp;rsquo;ve only been using the F# interactive console so far so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a try.
After reading about the somewhat convoluted approach required to use NUnit or MBUnit to write F# unit tests I came across XUnit.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on a few different agile projects and one of the things that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been completely consistent is when we consider a story to be &amp;lsquo;done&amp;rsquo;.
There seem to a few different approaches, each of which has its benefits and drawbacks.
Why do we care? We care about &#39;done&#39; for tracking the points we have achieved in an iteration and for knowing when we have added the value the story provides.</description>

I first came across this idea a few months ago when discussing null handling strategies with a colleague who pointed out that you could get around this problem in Scala by using the Option class.</description>

Project Overview   I worked on 5 projects this year writing code in C# 2.0/3.0, Java and Ruby.  2 of the projects were writing client side code, 2 web applications and 1 writing services. The domains I worked in were investment banking, insurance and an industrial automation system  What did I learn in 2008?</description>

      <description>I came across an interesting article written for Visual Studio Magazine about agile methodologies where the author makes what I consider to be some misconceptions.
The first is around the level of experience of people working on an agile team:
 For example, agile teams have a tendency to require a high level of experience and professionalism just to join the team.  I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I have a high level of experience and I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on agile teams for the past two years, just one data point suggesting that this statement is not actually accurate.</description>

I was intrigued to read the code though - you can always learn something by doing so and reading code is one of the ares that I want to improve in.</description>

      <description>The Book Talent is Overrated by Geoff Colvin
The Review I came across this book on Jason Yip&amp;rsquo;s Twitter feed while the idea of 10,000 hours to become an expert at any given skill was being discussed. I&amp;rsquo;m reading Outliers as well and the two books seem to complement each other quite well.
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in how we can apply deliberate practice in software development, perhaps using the medium of coding dojos, to become better developers in a more effective manner than just normal practice.</description>

      <description>One of the underlying characteristic of most of the projects I have worked on is that we have defined our own domain model.
On my current project due to the fact that most of the logic in the system is being handled through other services we decided to use WCF messages as the domain model, meaning that our domain model is being defined externally by the team defining the message contracts.</description>

The particular discussion was around an example like this:

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2008/12/25/tdd-does-it-make-you-slower/</guid>
      <description>There have been several times where we have been writing code in a test driven way and it has been suggested that we would be able to go much quicker if we stopped writing the tests and just wrote the code.
I feel this is a very short term way of looking at the problem and it does eventually come back to haunt you.
One of the problems seems to be that in many organisations only the first release of a piece of software is considered, and in this case then yes maybe it would be quicker to develop code in a non TDD fashion.</description>

      <description>I recently posted about my experiences of testing last where it became clear to me how important writing the test before the code is.
If we view the tests purely as a way of determining whether or not our code works correctly for a given set of examples then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much difference whether we test before or after we have written the code.
If on the other hand we want to get more value out of our tests such as having them the tests act as documentation, drive the design of our APIs and generally prove useful reading to ourself and others in future then a test first approach is the way to go.</description>

      <description>Another of the ideas I have picked up from my lean reading is that of trying things out without understanding exactly what is happening.
Or as The Toyota Way puts it&amp;hellip;  There are many things one doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand and therefore, we ask them why don&amp;rsquo;t you just go ahead and take action; try to do something? 
This is an approach which several colleagues I have worked with recently have been encouraging me to follow.</description>

      <description>The Book Lean Software Development by Mary and Tom Poppendieck
The Review I&amp;rsquo;m keen to learn how the ideas from The Toyota Way can be applied to software development and as far as I know this is the first book which addressed this, hence the reason for me reading it.
What did I learn?  I found the idea of financial based decisions particularly interesting - I&#39;ve often had situations when developing software where there are trade offs to make and it would have been much easier to make them if we had a dollar value associated with each potential solution.</description>

      <description>One of the ideas that I mentioned in a recent post about what I consider to be a good unit test was the ideas that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily consider the DRY (Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself) principle to be our number one driver.
I consider putting mock expectations in the setup methods of our tests to be one of those occasions where we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t obey this principle and I thought this would be fairly unanimously agreed upon but putting the question to the Twittersphere led to mixed opinions.</description>

      <description>One of the key ideas that I have learnt from my readings of The Toyota Way and Taaichi Ohno&amp;rsquo;s Workplace Management is that we should strive not to pass defects through the system to the next process, which you should consider to be your customer.
As a developer the next process for each story is the testing phase where the testers will (amongst other things) run through the acceptance criteria and then do some exploratory testing for scenarios which weren&amp;rsquo;t explicitly part of the acceptance criteria.</description>

      <description>While talking through my understanding of the Select method which can be applied to collections in C# with a colleague, it became clear that C# doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to use the same names for these type of operations as are used in the world of functional programming.
Coincidentally on the same day I came across Bill Six&amp;rsquo;s post about using functional collection parameters in Ruby, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d see what the equivalent operations are in C#.</description>

Last week we had a situation where we wanted to make use of the ForEach method on an IDictionary which we were using to store a collection of Selenium clients.
IDictionary&amp;lt;string, ISelenium&amp;gt; seleniumClients = new Dictionary&amp;lt;string, ISelenium&amp;gt;();  We wanted to write a piece of code to exit all of the clients when our tests had completed.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite additions to JUnit 4.4 was the @Theory annotation which allows us to write parameterised tests rather than having to recreate the same test multiple times with different data values or creating one test and iterating through our own collection of data values.
Previously, as far as I&amp;rsquo;m aware, it was only possible to parameterise tests by using the TestNG library which has some nice ideas around grouping tests but had horrible reporting the last time I used it.</description>

      <description>While reading Pat Kua&amp;rsquo;s latest post about how coding a certain way can help you avoid certain classes of bugs I was reminded of a technique taught to me by a colleague with regards to writing functions/methods.
The idea is that it is more effective to code for positive data values rather than trying to work out all the possible negative combinations, since there are likely to be cases which we hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered if we do the latter.</description>

      <description>My colleague Sarah Taraporewalla has written a series of posts recently about her experiences with TDD and introducing it at her current client.
While I agreed with the majority of the posts, one thing I found interesting was that in the conversation with a TDDer there were two tests being worked on at the same time (at least as far as I understand from the example).
This means that there will be two tests failing if we run our test suite, something which I try to avoid wherever possible.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working quite a lot with Javascript and in particular jQuery recently and since I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much in this area before all the tips and tricks are new to me.
One thing which is always useful no matter the programming language is to use it in a way that you can get rapid feedback on what you are doing.
Fortunately there are quite a few tools that allow us to do this with Javascript:</description>

      <description>The Book Taiichi Ohno&amp;rsquo;s Workplace Management by Taiichi Ohno
The Review Having completed The Toyota Way a few weeks ago I was speaking with Jason about what books were good to read next - he recommended this one and The Toyota Way Fieldbook.
I struggled to see a connection to software development with a lot of what I read, but there were certainly words of wisdom that we can apply to continuously improve our ability to deliver projects.</description>

      <title>Twitter as a learning tool</title>

      <description>About 8 or 9 months ago I remember having a conversation with a colleague where I asked him where he had got his almost encyclopedic knowledge of all things software development.
His reply at the time was that he read a lot of blogs and that this was where he had picked up a lot of the information.
While subscribing to different blogs remains a useful way of learning about different aspects of software development, I think Twitter is now becoming a very useful complementary tool to use alongside the RSS reader.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a recurring trend in the way that I learn new concepts which doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to fit exactly into any of the models of learning that I have come across so far.
It seems to me to be a learning cycle which goes something like this:
 Don&#39;t know what is good and what&#39;s bad Learn what&#39;s good and what&#39;s bad but don&#39;t know how to fix something that&#39;s bad Learn how to make something that&#39;s bad good  The two areas I have noticed this have both been related to concepts about writing clean code.</description>

      <description>No coding dojo update this week as Dave Thomas was in the ThoughtWorks Sydney office to talk about Managing Lean and Agile in Large Software Development.
It was actually a talk to the Geek Girls Sydney group but I sneaked in to hear his other talk after listening to the cloud computing one last week.
It was a much toned down presentation compared to the cloud computing one although still amusing in places.</description>

      <description>Following on from my post around the definition of a unit test, a recent discussion on the Test Driven Development mailing list led me to question what my own approach is for writing unit tests.
To self quote from my previous post:
 A well written unit test in my book should be simple to understand and run quickly.  Quite simple in theory but as I have learnt (and am still learning) the hard way, much harder to do in practice.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been working quite a bit with jQuery and cross browser compatibility and one of the interesting differences we came across today was the behaviour of Firefox and Internet Explorer when it comes to refreshing a page.
When you press refresh in Internet Explorer the page gets refreshed to the state that it was in when you first loaded the URL, meaning that the state of the data in forms is returned to its original state.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reviewing Apprenticeship Patterns over the last week or so and one of the cool ideas I came across is that of creating a Personal Practices Map.
The idea is that you draw up a list of your 10 most important practices for coding and design and draw out any relationships between them.
This is mine as of now:
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I follow all of these all the time, but they are the practices that I try to follow whenever possible.</description>

      <description>Chad Myers gets it spot on in his recent post about not testing private methods - private methods are private because they should be inaccessible from outside the class and their functionality should be tested via one of the public methods that calls them.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found that when a piece of code seems really difficult to test without exposing a private method then we&amp;rsquo;re probably trying to test that functionality from the wrong place.</description>

      <description>While working with the Html.RadioButton() UI helper for ASP.NET MVC we came across an interesting problem whereby when you submitted the form, all the values for that particular group of radio buttons was set to the value of the one that was selected.
For example, given a form like this:
&amp;lt;%= Html.RadioButton(&amp;quot;option1&amp;quot;, true) %&amp;gt;Yes &amp;lt;%= Html.RadioButton(&amp;quot;option2&amp;quot;, false)%&amp;gt;No  When we first load the page, this is the HTML it generated:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a big proponent of writing tests before writing code, and I roll off the standard reasons to people who question this approach:
 They help to drive the design They provide a safety net when making future changes They provide a way of communicating the intent of the code to the rest of the team  And so on. Despite knowing all this I recently took a non test driven approach to writing some bits of code - we were keen to get the system working end to end so it seemed a trade off worth making to prove that it was doable.</description>

      <description>While reading The Toyota Way one of the ideas which stood out for me was the constant mentioning of organisations which picked bits of The Toyota Way, implemented them, achieved some short term gains but then eventually these improvements and went back to the way they were before.
I noticed a similar theme coming out in the series of posts in the last week or so about the decline of agile.</description>

      <description>One of the things I really disliked when I first came across C# 3.0 code was lambda functions.
At the time I remember speaking to my Tech Lead and expressing the opinion that they were making the code harder to understand and were valuing conciseness over readability.
After a week of reading about the new C# features and understanding how they worked the code was now more readable to me and a lot of the boiler plate code that I had come to expect was no longer necessary.</description>

      <description>One of the interesting discussions that has come up on several projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on is whether or not we should test code that was written purely to help us test production code.
One of the main arguments used against testing test utility code is that it is not production code and therefore perhaps doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be held to the same standards because it lacks the complexity of production code.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s the seemingly small details of the agile/XP approach to software development that make it so much more effective than the traditional approach.
I was reminded of this last week with regards to having co-located teams with the developers, BAs, QAs and the business people all sitting in close proximity.
I was working on the auto completion function for one of our screens and the QA on the team, who was sitting next to me, asked me if I could look through the acceptance criteria that he was working on.</description>

      <description>While practicing some coding by doing the Roman number conversion last weekend I came across an article by Kent Beck which talked of a method he uses to remove the need to use the debugger to narrow down problems.
He calls the method the &amp;lsquo;Saff Squeeze&amp;rsquo; and the basic idea as I understand it is to write the original failing test and then inline the pieces of code that it calls, adding assertions earlier on in the code until the actual point of failure is found.</description>

Our initial idea was to bin deploy the ASP.NET MVC assemblies with the corresponding pdbs. Unfortunately this didn&amp;rsquo;t work and we got a conflict with the assemblies deployed in the GAC:

I was initially very skeptical about the value of lean in software development but became intrigued as to its potential value after listening to Jason championing it.

      <description>One of the common trends I have noticed in the stand ups of teams which practice pair programming is that very often the first person in the pair describes what they have been working on and what they will be doing today and then when it comes to the other person they say &amp;lsquo;ditto&amp;rsquo;.
After I dittoed one too many times on a project earlier this year it was pointed out to me that this was not a valuable way of contributing to the weekend and that I should describe my view of our progress as it may differ to my pair.</description>

      <description>In my final year of university a few years ago when I was applying for jobs I was really keen to join the (then) Reuters Graduate Technology program.
The thing that appealed to me the most was that over the 2 years you were on the graduate program you would have the opportunity to be placed in 4 different roles within the business. The website gives some examples:
 Technical architect, Project manager, Infrastructure service manager, Business analyst, Product &amp; development manager, Software engineer, Implementation engineer, Desktop design consultant, Technical specialist, Deployment project manager, Training  What I really liked about this idea was:</description>

      <description>One thing I&amp;rsquo;m learning from reading The Toyota Way is that visual indicators are a very important part of the Toyota Production System, and certainly my experience working in agile software development is that the same is true there.
We have certainly learnt this lesson with regards to continuous integration - the build is either red or green and it&amp;rsquo;s a very obvious visual indicator of the code base at any moment in time.</description>

We rotated one of the pair every 7 minutes using the Minutes OS X widget to keep track of time.</description>

We therefore decided to take a fairly similar approach to our weekly retrospectives in terms of having one column for &amp;lsquo;Like&amp;rsquo; and one for &amp;lsquo;Dislike&amp;rsquo;. In addition we had columns for &amp;lsquo;Want To Know More About&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Patterns&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>While reading Marc&amp;rsquo;s post about the Customer or Client naming dilemma I was reminded of another situation I have noticed in software development - the Client/User dilemma.
From my experience of agile projects it tends to be much more likely that we can get easy access to our client than to the users of the system we are writing.
Alistair Cockburn mentions in Crystal Clear that having an expert user sit with the team can be very useful, but it is not something that I have experienced on all the projects that I have worked on.</description>

      <description>One thing that we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on recently is the logging for our current code base.
Nearly all the objects in our system are being created by Pico Container so we decided that writing an interceptor that hooked into Pico Container would be the easiest way to intercept and log any exceptions throw from our code.
Our initial Googling led us to the AOP Style Interception page on the Pico website which detailed how we could create a static proxy for a class that we put in the container.</description>

      <description>The last two projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the project from right near the start, and one thing that&amp;rsquo;s been consistent in both projects is that we&amp;rsquo;ve spent time early on in the project trying to reduce technical risk.
In my most recent project this has involved getting infrastructure in place early on, and in the previous one it involved working on technical spikes for several weeks to prove that what the client was asking for was actually technically possible.</description>

      <description>Debugging 3rd party library code quickly and effectively is one of the skills which most obviously separates Senior and Junior developers from my experience.
From observation over the last couple of years there are some patterns in the approaches which the best debuggers take.
Get more information Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to understand exactly how to solve a problem without getting more information.
Verbose logging mode is available on the majority of libraries and provides the information showing how everything fits together which is normally enough information to work out how to solve the problem.</description>

      <title>Hamcrest Matchers - Make the error message clear</title>

      <description>We have been making good use of Hamcrest matchers on my current project for making assertions, and have moved almost entirely away from the more traditional JUnit assertEquals approach.
There are several reasons why I find the Hamcrest matcher approach to be more productive - it&amp;rsquo;s more flexible, more expressive and when an assertion fails we have a much better idea about why it has failed than if we use a JUnit assertion for example.</description>

      <description>Last week I came across what I have decided is the file system equivalent of commenting out code - not deleting directories when we are no longer using them.
The specific situation we ran into was while trying to make some Tomcat configuration changes but everything we changed was having no effect on what we were seeing on the web site.
Eventually we realised that we were actually changing the configuration in the wrong place - we actually had two Tomcat folder lying around.</description>

      <description>We ran an Object Calisthenics variation of Coding Dojo on Wednesday night as part of ThoughtWorks Geek Night in Sydney.
Object Calisthenics is an idea suggest by Jeff Bay in The ThoughtWorks Anthology , and lists 9 rules to writing better Object Oriented code. For those who haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the book, the 9 rules are:
 Use only one level of indentation per method  Don&#39;t use the else keyword Wrap all primitives and strings Use only one dot per line Don&#39;t abbreviate Keep all entities small Don&#39;t use any classes with more than two instance variables Use first-class collections Don&#39;t use any getters/setters/properties  We decided to try and solve the Bowling Game Problem while applying these rules.</description>

      <description>One of the interesting situations that can arise when pair programming is that one person dominates the driving and their pair can hardly get a look in.
This is not necessarily because they are hogging the keyboard - it is often just the case that they are the stronger technically in the pair and the other person isn&amp;rsquo;t willing to ask for the keyboard.
A big part of the value in pair programming comes from having both people taking turns at driving and navigating from my experience and there are several ideas that I have come across for trying to encourage a more collaborative approach to pair programming.</description>

      <description>The Book Crystal Clear by Alistair Cockburn
The Review This was a book which had been recommended to me by a colleague a few months ago as one of the best software development books to read, and after hearing Ian Cooper describe how his team was implementing some of the ideas at the Alt.NET conference I decided I&amp;rsquo;d give it a read.
I have been working in an Agile/XP environment at ThoughtWorks for the last two years so my context coming into the book was around understanding where the overlap with Crystal Clear was, what differences there are and how I can apply these on my projects</description>

      <description>On my current project we&amp;rsquo;ve been having some discussions around the frequency with which we rotate pairs, the feeling being that we probably keep the same pairs for a bit too long.
We discussed using techniques such as promiscuous pairing, which takes the idea of pair rotation to an extreme, but have settled on making our rotations more or less daily.
One interesting thing I noticed from some recent pair switching was the immediate benefit we can realise from the pair rotation.</description>

      <description>In order to experience the full benefits of pair programming it is important to try and reduce the chance of the navigator getting bored and losing focus.
One of the main ways that we can do this is by ensuring that we have a quick turnaround between the driver and navigator, and this can be done by ensuring that when we are driving we are doing so as quickly as possible.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last few days working with CSS, and in particular trying to make a layout which works perfectly fine in Firefox work properly in Internet Explorer 6.
I&amp;rsquo;m far from an expert when it comes to this but I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up a few lessons from our attempts to get identical layouts in both browsers.
  Internet Explorer seems to do some crazy stuff when it comes to padding and margins - we were often ending up with huge margins where we hadn&#39;t even specified any.</description>

      <description>Continuing with my mini Hibernate mappings series, this post talks about the different ways of setting up the test data for our Hibernate tests.
 Where to test the mappings from? How to test for equality? How to setup the test data?  There are a couple of ways that we can setup data for Hibernate tests.
Insert Hibernate Object This approach involves creating a new object and saving it to the database using the save method on the Hibernate session.</description>

      <description>I started a mini Hibernate series with my last post where I spoke of there being three main areas to think about when it comes to testing:
 Where to test the mappings from? How to test for equality? How to setup the test data?  Once we have worked out where to test the mappings from, if we have decided to test them through either our repository tests or directly from the Hibernate session then we have some choices to make around how to test for equality.</description>

There are three decisions to make around how best to do this:

      <description>Through my continued use of buildr on my current project one thing we wanted to do last week was to run our production code tests using some code from the test-utilities project along with its dependencies.
I thought this would be the default behaviour but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Looking at the documentation suggested we could achieve this by calling &amp;lsquo;compile.dependencies&amp;rsquo; on the project, but from what I can tell you still need to explicitly state that you want to use the main test utilities code as well.</description>

While activating some acceptance tests this week I noticed quite a strange error happening if the tests ran in a certain order:
com.thoughtworks.selenium.SeleniumException: ERROR: Current window or frame is closed! at com.thoughtworks.selenium.HttpCommandProcessor.doCommand(HttpCommandProcessor.java:73) at com.thoughtworks.selenium.HttpCommandProcessor.getString(HttpCommandProcessor.java:154) at com.</description>

      <description>One of the very common pitfalls I make when working on things is to get so engrossed in the technical details of the problem that I completely forget the reason for doing it in the first place.
Over the last week or so I have noticed myself trying to solve some ridiculous problems without considering whether I am solving the right problem in the first place.
To give an example, I was working with Hibernate earlier in the week trying to setup a new mapping between two entities which involved creating a composite key on one of the entities, which led to us having to work out how to do that on the database, then editing our migration script, then trawling Google to work out why our mapping wasn&amp;rsquo;t working, before a colleague overheard our pain and pointed out that we had over complicated matters.</description>

      <description>One of the features that I dislike in Java compared to C# is checked exceptions.
For me an exception is about a situation which is exceptional, and if we know that there is a possibility of it happening and even have that possibility defined in our code then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem all that exceptional to me.
Having said that they do at least provide information which you can&amp;rsquo;t help but notice about what can go wrong when you make a call to a particular method.</description>

      <description>I recently came across this post which speaks about the desire of recruiters to put candidates into technology specific boxes when it comes to describing their experience.
I guess this desire is backed by humans&amp;rsquo; need to see the patterns and similarities in data and having someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit into a generalised box makes it more difficult.
I have worked on projects in Java, C# and a bit of Ruby so I do agree with most of the points with regards to language specialisation and as Jay Fields points out it is actually beneficial to diversify your experience to improve yourself.</description>

      <description>One problem that we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to solve today is how to make a RESTlet resource non cacheable.
The reason for this is that when a user logs out of the system and then hits the back button they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to see that page, but instead should see the login form.
After several hours of trawling Google and trying out various different suggestions we came across the idea of setting &amp;lsquo;cache-control&amp;rsquo; with the value &amp;lsquo;no-store&amp;rsquo; in the response headers.</description>

The Review I came across this book while watching an interview with Linda Rising on InfoQ. She mentioned some ideas from Malcolm Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s The Tipping Point which intrigued me and a strong recommendation from a colleague ensured this book made it onto my reading list.
I am not currently working on a project where I need to instigate a lot of change so I was going slightly against my own principle of only reading books when I need to, but I recalled several times previously when I have tried to introduce what I thought were good ideas and didn&amp;rsquo;t really get anywhere.</description>

      <description>One of the things I dislike the most when coding is writing if statements. and while I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that if should be completely abolished from our toolkit, I think the anti if campaign started about a year ago is going along the right lines.
While there is certainly value in using an if statement as a guard block it usually feels that we have missed an abstraction if we are using it elsewhere.</description>

      <description>On the previous project I was working on one of the pain points we were having was around setting up developer environments such that you could get the code up and running on a machine as quickly as possible.
I would go to a newly formatted machine ready to set it up for development and run into a cascading list of dependencies I hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered.
SVN wasn&amp;rsquo;t installed, then Ruby, then we had the wrong version of Java and all the while we were wasting time when this process could have been automated.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve not tried doing these before but I thought it would be an interesting activity to try out.
The Kata Code Kata One - Supermarket Pricing
What I learnt   As this kata is not supposed to be a coding exercise I started out just modeling ideas in my head about how I would do it before I realised that this wasn&#39;t working as an effective way for me to learn.</description>

      <description>In an earlier post about Team Productivity I stumbled upon the idea that while pair programming there could be such a concept as pair flow.
The term &amp;lsquo;flow&amp;rsquo; is used to describe a situation where you are totally immersed in the work you&amp;rsquo;re doing and where time seems to go by without you even noticing.
This can also happen when pair programming and I think there are some factors which can make it more likely.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago my colleague Mark Thomas posted about working on a C# project after 10 years working in Java, and being someone who has worked on projects in both languages fairly consistently (3 Java projects, 2 .NET projects) over the last two years I thought it would be interesting to do a comparison between the two.
The standard ThoughtWorks joke is that you just need to remember to capitalise the first letter of method names in C# and then you&amp;rsquo;re good to go but I think there&amp;rsquo;s more to it than that.</description>

      <description>One pattern I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed over the last couple of years with regards to my own learning is that I find it very difficult to learn new things unless I can directly apply what I have learnt to a real life situation.
I feel this was part of the reason I found the way material is taught at universities so difficult to understand - nearly every course I studied was taught on its own without any reference to the others, and rarely did I get to use the ideas I learnt in a practical context.</description>

      <description>I think that out of all the Extreme Programming practices Test Driven Development is the one which I like the best. I feel it provides a structure for development work and helps me to remain focused on what I am trying to achieve rather than writing code which may not necessarily be needed.
However, there are times when it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to use a TDD approach, and Pat Kua suggested earlier this year that if you&amp;rsquo;re using a TDD approach all the time you&amp;rsquo;re doing something wrong.</description>

      <title>What is a unit test?</title>

      <description>One of the questions which came up during the Sydney Alt.NET User Group meeting at the start of October was around what a unit test actually is.
I suppose the somewhat naive or simplistic definition is that it is just any test written using an xUnit framework such as NUnit or JUnit. However, integration or acceptance tests are often written using these frameworks so this definition doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold.
While discussing this last week a colleague came up with what I considered to be a very clear yet precise definition.</description>

      <description>In the comments of my previous post on pairing Vivek made the following comment about when we should pair:
 The simplest principle I have is to use &#34;conscious&#34; pairing vs. &#34;unconscious&#34; pairing. A pair should always *know* why they are pairing.  On previous projects I have worked on there have been several tasks where it has been suggested that there is little value in pairing. I decided to try and apply Vivek&amp;rsquo;s principle of knowing why we might pair on these tasks to see if there is actually any value in doing so.</description>

      <description>The Book Test Driven Development by Example by Kent Beck
The Review I know this book is quite old but I haven&amp;rsquo;t read it before - it&amp;rsquo;s been recommended to me several times but I never got round to reading it, possibly because of my somewhat misguided opinion that seeing as I do TDD nearly every day I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to read it.
More by chance than anything else, I was browsing through a friend&amp;rsquo;s copy of the book and came across several gems of information which persuaded me that I should take the time to read the rest of it.</description>

      <description>We have been using rspec on my project for the unit testing of our Ruby code and while running one of the specs last week I ended up getting this somewhat en-cryptic error message:
Invalid character &#39;\240&#39; in expression ...  After convincing myself that this error wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually possible it turned out that I had somehow entered an &amp;lsquo;invisible to TextMate&amp;rsquo; character after one of the method definitions - on the editor it just looked like a space.</description>

      <description>Damana and I previously posted about our experiences with different Ruby LDAP solutions.
Having settled on Ruby-LDAP (although having read Ola and Steven&amp;rsquo;s comments we will now look at ruby-net-ldap) we then needed to put together the setup, installation and teardown into a ruby script file.
A quick bit of Googling revealed that we could use the Kernel.exec method to do this.
For example, you could put the following in a ruby script file and it would execute and show you the current directory listing:</description>

      <description>The Book Pragmatic Learning and Thinking by Andy Hunt
The Review I came across this book when reading a post linking lean to the Dreyfus Model on Dan North&amp;rsquo;s blog.
I have a keen interest in theories of learning and have completed an NLP Practitioner&amp;rsquo;s course so the ideas described in the book summary immediately appealed to me.
After coming across the concept of Reading Deliberately in Chapter 6 of the book I decided I should give the SQ3Q approach to reading books its first run out.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in an earlier post a colleague and I spent a few days looking at how to connect to an OpenDS LDAP server using Ruby.
We ended up analysing four different solutions for solving the problem.
Active LDAP This approach involved using the Active LDAP Ruby which &#34;provides an object oriented interface to LDAP. It maps LDAP entries to Ruby objects with LDAP attribute accessors based on your LDAP server&#39;s schema and each object&#39;s objectClasses&#34;</description>

      <description>As my Ruby journey continues one of the things I wanted to do today was parse a CSV file.
This article proved to be very useful for teaching the basics but it didn&amp;rsquo;t say how to ignore the header line that the CSV file contained.
The CSV file I was parsing was similar to this:
name, surname, location Mark, Needham, Sydney David, Smith, London  I wanted to get the names of people originally to use them in my code.</description>

      <description>A few of my colleagues recently posted their opinions about acceptance tests which tied in nicely with a discussion about acceptance testing that was had at the Alt.NET conference in London.
For the sake of argument I will assume that when we refer to acceptance tests we are talking about tests at the GUI level which are being automatically driven by a tool, usually Selenium but maybe something like White if it is a client side application.</description>

      <description>I spent a bit of time this afternoon marveling at the non intuitiveness of working out how to ignore files in Svn.
Normally I&amp;rsquo;d just use Tortoise SVN as it makes it so easy for you but I really wanted to know how to do it from the shell!
After a bit of Googling and conversation with a colleague I think I have it figured out to some extent.
Ignoring just one file or pattern If you only have one pattern or file that you want to ignore then the following command should do the trick.</description>

      <description>In the world of Ruby I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a script which needs to unzip a file and then run an installer which is only available after unpacking it.
We&amp;rsquo;ve been using the rubyzip gem to do so but so far it hasn&amp;rsquo;t felt intuitive to me coming from the Java/C# world.
ZipFile is the class we need to use and at first glance I had thought that it would be possible to just pass the zip file name to the &amp;lsquo;extract&amp;rsquo; method and have it do all the work for me!</description>

Richard and James have already written summaries of what went on but I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give some of my thoughts as well.</description>

      <description>Roy Osherove and several others have posted recently about introducing TDD to the &amp;lsquo;masses&amp;rsquo;
As I understand it Roy&amp;rsquo;s idea is to separate the learning of TDD from the learning of good design principles - good design principles in this case being the OOP principles described in Uncle Bob&amp;rsquo;s Agile Software Development Principles, Practices and Practices or on the Object Mentor website.
I am usually in favour of an approach that breaks a skill down into chunks so that it is easier to learn but in this case I feel that some of the big gains in coding in a TDD way is the decoupled design it encourages, which in my experience is more likely to follow good design principles.</description>

      <description>A colleague and I have spent the past couple of days spiking solutions for connecting to LDAP servers from Ruby.
We decided that the easiest way to do this is by using OpenDS, an open source directory service based on LDAP.
One option we came up with for doing this was to make use of the Java libraries for connecting to the LDAP server and then calling through to these from our Ruby code using the Ruby Java Bridge.</description>

      <description>My former colleague Vivek Vaid has an interesting post about parallel-paired programming where he talks about introducing lean concepts into deciding when we should pair to get maximum productivity.
Midway through the post he mentions that the original reason that we starting pairing was for &amp;lsquo;collaborative design&amp;rsquo; which got me thinking whether there are reasons beyond this why we would want to pair.
I have often worked on clients where the value of pair programming has been questioned and it has been suggested that we should only adhere to this practice for tasks where it adds most value.</description>

      <description>While playing around with JBehave I was reminded of my dislike of the import static feature which was introduced in Java 1.5.
Using import static allows us to access static members defined in another class without referencing the class name. For example suppose we want to use the following method in our code:
Math.max(1,2);  Normally we would need to include the class name (Math) that the static function (max) belongs to.</description>

The underlying message for me was that a lot of the concepts we apply for onshore projects are equally important for offshore projects.
Forrester&amp;rsquo;s Tim Sheedy started off by providing some research data on the state of IT offshoring, some reasons he had identified around which type of work should be offshored before closing on some reasons that it might fail if not done correctly.</description>

Nevertheless when testing with Joda Time there are times when it would be useful for us to have control over the time our code is using.

The technique is the TOTE (Test, Operate, Test, Exit) and it is a technique designed to help us get from where we are now to where we want to be via short feedback loops.
On my previous project we had a situation where we needed to build and deploy our application in order to show it to the client in a show case.</description>

As always in software we never have a silver bullet and there are times when Domain Model is not necessarily the best choice, just as there are times when OOP is not necessarily the best choice.</description>

      <description>Assuming that you are unable to use Joda Time on your project, there are some simple ways that I have come across that allow you to not suffer at the hands of java.util.Date.
What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with java.util.date in the first place? First of all java.util.date is mutable. This means that if you create a java.util.date object its state can be modified after creation.
This means that you can do an operation like the following, for example:</description>

      <description>On my previous project one of the areas that we needed to work out how to test was around interaction with the file system.
The decision that we needed to make was whether we should unit test this type of functionality or whether it could just be covered by a functional test.
To Unit Test One of the patterns to use when unit testing things like this is the Gateway pattern.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Neal Ford&amp;rsquo;s The Productive Programmer (my review) which is a book all about improving your productivity as an individual developer.
It got me thinking that there are also ways that we can make teams more productive so that they are actually teams and not just a group of individuals who happen to work with each other.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity of working under some great Tech Leads who have helped create an environment where teams can perform to their maximum.</description>

      <description>Early last year I became very curious about what it was that made the best developers in the industry so good at what they do.
Jay Fields points out some things that he believes indicate that a developer is good at the end of this post but a former colleague and I tried to come up with a list of areas that any Developer needed to be skilled in to justifiably consider themselves good.</description>

First of all kudos to Ian Cooper, Alan Dean and Ben Hall for arranging it. There seemed to be a lot more people around than for the one in February which no doubt took a lot of arranging.
It was again run using the open spaces format and we started with an interesting discussion on what Alt.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve covered some of the ways that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen for making builds configurable in previous posts:
 One configuration file per environment One configuration file per user Overriding properties  One which I haven&amp;rsquo;t covered which my colleagues Gil Peeters and Jim Barritt have pointed out is having a build with one configuration file for each machine.
Again the setup is fairly similar to one configuration per user or environment. Using Nant we would have the following near the top of the build file:</description>

      <description>A couple of my colleagues have been posting about how to name your unit tests based on this original post by Jay Fields.
I think that test names are useful, especially when written in a BDD style expressing what a test is supposed to be doing.
For example, in a C# NUnit test we might see the following as a test name:
[Test] public void ShouldDoSomething() { // Code testing that we&#39;re doing something }  I write all my tests like this and I&amp;rsquo;m often asked what the point of the &amp;lsquo;Should&amp;rsquo; is, why not just name it &amp;lsquo;DoSomething&amp;rsquo;.</description>

One of the most interesting things I learnt from the book is that when you bring together a diverse group of people, their output will probably be better than any one expert. Gojko points out this example that was used at Agile 2008:</description>

      <guid>https://markhneedham.com/blog/2008/09/02/configurable-builds-overriding-properties/</guid>
      <description>Sometimes when configuring our build for flexibility we don&amp;rsquo;t need to spend the time required to create one build configuration per user or one build configuration per environment.
In these cases we can just override properties when we call Nant from the command line.
One recent example where I made use of this was where we had one configuration file with properties in but wanted to override a couple of them when we ran the continuous integration build.</description>

      <description>Following on from my first post about making builds configurable, the second way of doing this that I have seen is to have one configuration build file per user.
This approach is more useful where there are different configurations needed on each developer machine. For example, if the databases being used for development are on a remote server then each developer machine would be assigned a database with a different name.</description>

      <description>One of the most important things when coding build files is to try and make them as configurable as possible.
At the very least on an agile project there will be a need for two different configurations - one for developer machines and one for continuous integration.
On my last two .NET projects we have setup our Nant build to take in a parameter which indicates which build configuration should be used.</description>

When doing this it appeared clear that there were two situations that we were trying to avoid:
Under estimating Under estimating is where we predict that the amount of time taken to complete a piece of work will be less than it actually is.</description>

      <description>I mentioned earlier that I have been playing around with LINQ to Xml for parsing a Visual Studio csproj file.
While having namespace issues I decided to try and parse a simpler Xml file to try and work out what I was doing wrong.
Given this fragment of Xml:
&amp;lt;Node&amp;gt; &amp;lt;InnerNode&amp;gt;mark&amp;lt;/InnerNode&amp;gt; &amp;lt;InnerNode&amp;gt;needham&amp;lt;/InnerNode&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/Node&amp;gt;  I wanted to get a collection(IEnumerable) of InnerNode values.
Unfortunately my over enthusiasm to use anonymous types meant that I caused myself more problems than I needed to.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my earlier post I have been working with Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Thrift messaging project.
Unfortunately there are not currently any C# examples of how to use the Data Transfer Objects the Thrift compiler generates for us on the official wiki.
We managed to figure out how to do it by following the Java instructions and converting them into C# code. Before writing any code we need to import Thrift.</description>

      <description>Thrift is a Facebook released open source project for cross language serialisation and RPC communication.
We made use of it for our message definition layer - when it comes to messaging I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of the event based approach so we left the RPC stuff well alone.
Why Thrift? The reason we used Thrift in the first place was because we had a requirement to get interoperability between a Java and .</description>

The first thing we tried to do was get a list of all the references from the file. It seemed like a fairly easy problem to solve but for some reason nothing was getting returned:
XDocument projectFile = XDocument.Load(projectFilePath.Path); var references = from itemGroupElement in projectFile.Descendants(&amp;quot;ItemGroup&amp;quot;).First().Elements() select itemGroupElement.</description>

The main discussion often centres around how often the balance should be updated. From my experience there are two main ways that we can go about this:
Real time update after every transaction This is perhaps the most obvious approach and the implementation is fairly simple.</description>

      <description>One of the first things that I do when I go onto a project is setup a ReSharper template for writing tests.
I generally set this up so that when I type &amp;lsquo;should&amp;rsquo; I can press tab and it will automatically create an outline of a test method for me.
Creating a template is as simple as going to &amp;lsquo;ReSharper &amp;gt; Live Templates&amp;rsquo; from Visual Studio.
I have attached several templates that I seem to end up writing over and over again.</description>

      <description>I touched earlier on the transparency of agile and I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about some of the ways that we track/report information in agile projects.
In all the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in the data being tracked almost exclusively referred to development time. One of the advantages of having continuous analysis/development/testing is that we are able to reduce the time spent on the System Integration and User Acceptance Testing phases of the project.</description>

      <description>One of the key ideas behind agile software development is providing information as early as possible to allow the business to best make decisions.
There are a variety of ways that this is done including the use of burn up charts, estimates of scope and velocity for example. This data is compiled to try and give an accurate idea of how long a project is likely to take so that the business can work out early on whether the value it adds is worth the expected cost.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve read some posts which cover parts of this process but nothing which covers the end to end process so hopefully my experience can help to fill that void.
Step 1 Download NCover 1.5.8, NCover Explorer 1.4.0.7, NCover Explorer Extras 1.4.0.5 from Kiwidude&#39;s website and the NCover website . Step 2 Put the following into your Nant build file: ~~~text ~~~ I put this right at the top of the build but I expect it doesn&#39;t matter where it goes as long as it&#39;s called at some stage before NCover and NCover Explorer are called.</description>

      <description>When writing build scripts it&amp;rsquo;s very easy for it to descend into complete Xml hell when you&amp;rsquo;re using a tool like nant.
I wondered previously whether it was possible to TDD build files and while this is difficult given the dependency model most build tools follow. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we can&amp;rsquo;t apply other good design principles from the coding world however.
Encapsulation is one of the key principles of OOP and it can be applied in build files too.</description>

&#39;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\MSBuild.Exe ( Proj.csproj /p:OutputPath=\output\path\ /p:Configuration=Release)&#39;  To no avail. It still created the pdb file. Next I tried setting the &amp;lsquo;DebugSymbols&amp;rsquo; property to false:

      <description>Sometimes the simplest things can provide the greatest value to project teams. We often look for a technical solution to problems where something simpler would achieve the same aim.
The Information Wall is as its name may suggest a place where you can put information that people in the team need to know but which they have not (yet) committed to memory.
Examples of things that you could put on an information wall could be:  Wiki url SVN repository url Remote machine names &amp;amp; credentials Build server url Useful phone numbers Anything else that&amp;rsquo;s needed!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to integrate NCover into our build and probably making life harder for myself than it needs to be.
The title refers to the error message that I was getting when trying to run the ncover nant task on version 1.0.1 of NCover earlier today.
[ncover] Starting &#39;C:\Program Files\NCover\ncover-console.exe (//r &amp;quot;\long\path\to\tmp392.tmp.ncoversettings&amp;quot; )&#39; in &#39;C:\my-project\trunk\src&#39; [ncover] Unhandled Exception: System.ArgumentException: Requested value &#39;/r&#39; was not found.

      <title>From Prototype to Delivery</title>

      <description>Projects often reach the interesting point where the prototyping and development phases intersect and there are some interesting decisions to make.
From a development point of view the biggest decision is what to do with the code that has been developed.
When developing prototypes the focus tends to be on getting something to work quick and dirty. Not a lot of time is put into considering edge cases or error conditions or any of the other niceties that are needed for software to be usable in an enterprise environment.</description>

      <description>When pair programming there are obviously times when you have different opinions about how things should be done.
One of these is the way that we should return from methods. There seem to be two approaches when it comes to this: Exit as quickly as possible The goal with this approach is as the title suggests, to get out of the method at the earliest possible moment.
The Guard Block is the best example of this.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with C#&amp;rsquo;s Xml libraries today and in particular the XmlWriter class.
I wanted to use it to create an Xml document so I called the XmlWriter.Create() method. One of the overloads for this methods takes in a StringBuilder which I initially thought the XmlWriter used to create the Xml document.
In fact it actually writes the Xml Document into this StringBuilder. This is actually possible to deduct from the documentation provided on the Create method but I only glanced at the type needed initially and misunderstood how it worked.</description>

I had always thought that was a silver bullet for the way that we can handle null objects in our code but it seems from reading other people&amp;rsquo;s opinions and from my own experience that this is not the case (surprise, surprise!</description>

      <description>The way we have setup the build on our continuous integration server, Team City is configured to create a new tag every time the functional tests past successful on that machine.
We then have a QA and Showcase build that we can run to deploy all the artifacts necessary to launch the application on that machine.
Originally I had just written the batch script to take in the tag of the build which the user could find by looking through repo-browser for the last tag created.</description>

      <description>One of the first things I noticed when coming into the world of C# 3.0 was the use of the key word &amp;lsquo;var&amp;rsquo; all over our code base.
I had read about it previously and was under the impression that its main use would be when writing code around LINQ or when creating anonymous types.
On getting Resharper to tidy up my code I noticed that just about every variable type declaration had been removed and replaced with var.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite features of ant is the ability to create macros where you can define common behaviour and then call it from the rest of your build script.
Unfortunately that task doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with nant and it&amp;rsquo;s not available on nant-contrib either.
We were using a very roundabout way to build the various projects in our solution.

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been using msbuild to build our project files on my current project and a colleague and I noticed some strange behaviour when trying to set the directory that the output should be built to.
The problem was whenever we tried to set the output directory (using OutDir) to somewhere where there was a space in the directory name it would just fail catastrophically. We spent ages searching for the command line documentation before finding it here.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s becoming quite a couple of weeks of learning for me around DOS and I have another tip that I just learnt today.
I always found it really frustrating when using the windows command prompt that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get Unix style tab auto completion. To navigate my way to a directory I would do the following:   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ~~~  C:&amp;gt;cd Downloads  C:\Downloads&amp;gt;cd nant-0.</description>

      <description>When it comes to Pair Programming the Junior/Junior pairing is considered the most likely to lead to disaster. The old joke being that if you pair two Junior Developers together then you&amp;rsquo;d better hope you have a revert function on your repository. But is this fair?
Certainly pairing two Junior Developers together means that you automatically lose the value of the experience and mentoring skills that you would get if there was a Senior Developer as part of the pair.</description>

I thought it would be relatively simple, but after various searches and having read articles that suggested that there wasn&amp;rsquo;t an ELSE construct in batch land I finally found a forum post which explained how to do it.</description>

Pat explains the idea on his website but to summarise; the idea is that given a story, you break it down into the individual tasks that need to be done in order for it to be complete, write each tasks on a sticky and then when that task is finished throw the sticky away.</description>

      <description>In the world of batch files I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying for ages to work out how to get the current/present working directory to make the batch script I&amp;rsquo;m working on a bit more flexible.
In Unix it&amp;rsquo;s easy, just call &amp;lsquo;pwd&amp;rsquo; and you have it. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting something that simple in Windows but it is! A call to &amp;lsquo;cd&amp;rsquo; is all that&amp;rsquo;s needed. If you need to set it in a batch script the following line does the trick:    ~~~  set WORKING_DIRECTORY=%cd%~~~    I was surprised that something so simple (I do now feel like an idiot) wasn&amp;rsquo;t easier to find on Google.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about pair programming in some of my previous posts as I find the dynamic it creates quite intriguing.
One idea which was suggested around the time I wrote those posts by my project manager at the time was developers pairing with the QA or BA on certain tasks. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to experience it on that particular project but over the last week I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing quick a bit of build work and for some of that I was pairing with our QA.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s often said that people who are really good at what they do are so good at it because they have narrowed their focus in their area of specialty until they are only doing the thing that they are good at.
To use a football analogy, Manchester United&amp;rsquo;s Cristiano Ronaldo - widely acknowledged as the best footballer in the world at the moment - is absolutely brilliant when he has the ball at his feet, taking on defenders, getting in shots around the opposition penalty area.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a bit of work around controlling the state of the windows of applications launched programmatically.
The problem we were trying to solve is to launch an arbitrary application, move it around the screen and then save its window position on the screen so that next time it&amp;rsquo;s launched it loads in the same position.
There are some win32 APIs designed to do just this, although it took a fair bit of searching and trial and error to work out exactly how to use them.</description>

      <description>It seems programmers are taking a bit of a hammering this week!
Kris Kemper talks about the Net Negative Producing Programmer referring to a paper linked to by Jay Fields, concluding that the code submission is very important in helping to distinguish between good and bad candidates.
Now I probably haven&amp;rsquo;t done as many interviews at ThoughtWorks as Kris has but from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of the recruitment process it seems to be more focused on ensuring that potential hires culturally fit into the organisation rather than that they write the best code that anyone has ever seen.</description>

I thought this wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible in Visual Studio and had resigned myself to trying to remember which project each file was in. Luckily for me a colleague pointed out that it is in fact possible but is just turned off by default.

      <description>Since reading The Pragmatic Programmer I&amp;rsquo;ve become a bit of an automation junkie and writing batch scripts falls right under that category.
Unfortunately, nearly every single time I write one I forget that Windows really hates it when you have spaces in variable assignments, and I forget how to print out a usage message if the right number of parameters are not passed in.
So as much for me as for everyone else, this is how you do it:   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ~~~  @ECHO off IF [%1]==[] GOTO usage IF [%2]==[] GOTO usage  set VAR1=%1 set VAR2=%2  rem important client stuff  goto end  :usage echo Usage: script.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re running quite a few different builds which have dependencies on each other and it&amp;rsquo;s been pretty much one click on the web admin tool to get that set up.
One thing that had me really confused is the default location it chooses to build from. The problem is that it seems to change arbitrarily, with the folder name it builds in being calculated from a VSC hash (not sure quite how that&amp;rsquo;s worked out but there we go).</description>

As a consultant I often go onto projects where a significant amount of difficult to understand and often untested code is in place. At times it feels like the people who have written it really don&amp;rsquo;t care about the quality of their work which can be very disheartening.</description>

      <description>Although modern day IDEs (Eclipse, IntelliJ, Resharper etc) undoubtedly provide a lot of benefits when writing code, I am starting to wonder if the ease at which they make things possible actually encourages bad habits.
Useful features such as creating and initialising member variables from the definition of a constructor are quickly nullified by the ease at which one is able to create getters/setters/properties for these same member variables. All hopes of encapsulation gone with a few clicks of the mouse.</description>

      <description>One of the intriguing aspects of pair programming for me is that of the non driving person in the pair – what are they supposed to do?!
Obviously there are fairly well known strategies for more interactive pairing, such as Ping Pong and Ball and Board (which is where one person controls the mouse and the other the keyboard), but neither of these strategies suggest what to do when you are not driving</description>

      <description>One of the more interesting concepts used on the NLP course that I did last year was the idea of only giving positive feedback to people.
The thinking behind the theory (which I think comes from Robert Dilts, one of the early thinkers behind NLP) is that people know what they are doing wrong and already beat themselves up about it; therefore there is no point you mentioning it as well.</description>

      <description>I’ve had the opportunity to have worked with many different people pair programming wise over the last year or so, and having seen it done in several different ways thought it would be interesting to work through some of my thoughts about this Extreme Programming (XP) originated practice.
First of all it seems to me that pair programming is a technique that is used with a lot more frequency at ThoughtWorks than at any other IT organisation.</description>

      <title>Learning theory first</title>

      <description>I’ve always been the type of person who only gets the motivation to do something if there is some useful practical reason for doing so. It therefore probably doesn’t come as much of a surprise that I hated the majority of my mostly theoretical computer science degree.
I was talking to one of my colleagues last week and came out of the conversation convinced that the desire to know the theory behind concepts is amplified when you actually get to see it in action in a real life system.</description>

      <title>Active listening</title>

      <description>One of the first unusual (to me) things that I noticed from the trainers at ThoughtWorks University was that when they were listening to participants they would often ask questions and re-frame the participants&amp;rsquo; comments. Intrigued and impressed by this I spoke to one of the trainers and was told that they were engaging in &amp;lsquo;active listening&amp;rsquo;. Wikipedia defines the term as follows:   Active listening is an intent &amp;ldquo;listening for meaning&amp;rdquo; in which the listener checks with the speaker to see that a statement has been correctly heard and understood.</description>

      <title>Giving effective feedback</title>

      <description>One of the most interesting things I have discovered since starting at ThoughtWorks earlier this month is the emphasis that is placed on giving feedback.
The first lesson we were taught about giving feedback was that it could be one of two types. Either it should Strengthen Confidence or Increase Effectiveness.
In Layman&amp;rsquo;s term that means that if you want to make a positive comment about somebody&amp;rsquo;s contribution then you should make reference to something specific that you believe they have done well so that they can continue doing it.</description>

      <title>Inheritance and Delegation</title>

      <description>One of the major learning points this week at TWU has been understanding when it is appropriate to use inheritance and when delegation is the better choice.
I had heard stories about how inheritance could be misused but I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I would be stupid enough to fall straight into that trap! We were taught the concept using &amp;lsquo;Measurement&amp;rsquo; as the problem domain. So to translate the previous sentence into English: The aim was to design classes which could handle old school measurement types such as Inches, Feet, Yards, and so on.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always found it fascinating watching people who really excel in their field going about business, be it footballers, tennis players, actors, whoever.
This week at TWU I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with some Ruby on Rails as I mentioned in the previous post, and yesterday I had the opportunity to watch one of the leading figures in the Ruby on Rails field at work. Take a bow Obie Fernandez, who gave several of the TWU attendees a demonstration of how to develop applications using Ruby on Rails.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a lot about Ruby on Rails over the last couple of years but I&amp;rsquo;d never really been intrigued to get it set up on my machine and &amp;lsquo;have a play&amp;rsquo; with it so to speak.
It turned out to be a relatively painless process and after following the instructions on the official site I had it all setup within about half an hour which was a record for me for getting a development environment setup.</description>
